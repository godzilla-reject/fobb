# Introduction
Welcome to the first playtest for *Fable of the Behemoth Breakers*, a Monster-Hunting Tabletop Roleplaying Game. In this world, you are a *Breaker*, a warrior trained in powerful magic and massive weaponry to engage in combat with Behemoths, creatures that routinely emerge from the Uberwald to attempt to destroy mortal settlements. 

Breakers are organized into Companies, and it is these Companies that strike out into the Uberwald to claim territory and begin new settlements. You won't be making your Company this playtest, but that *is* the planned focus of Playtest 3!

The goals for *this* playtest are as follows:
- Test the basics of Character Creation: I need to know if it works, and if it works well. 
- Get a measure of Character Creation enjoyability. If it sucks to do, it needs work!
- Address early mechanical issues. Right now, as the game is in its infancy, foundational mechanics need to be set in stone.

This playtest is *just* the character creation. There are no test rolls, no equipment, nothing like that. All of that will come in the *next* playtest.

The next section will tell you the materials you need for this playtest; it isn't much, and I've provided most of it!
## Required Materials
The necessary materials you'll need are:
- Basic Reading Ability 
- [The Official Behemoth Breaker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n2CYNY7mnI1LOLS1rMADno1L36xFq9Jyu9224PD4lhM/edit?usp=sharing) character sheet. It does most of the math for you, just to save us all some time.
- [Your Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/cTnMRPeQyNd4p6qf9).
# Part 1: Character Creation 
Welcome to the main section of the playtest! Before reading further, make sure you've gotten done with Section 1 of the Feedback form. This will save you some time later! 
 
## Attribute Traits
Attribute traits are a Breakers physical, mental and spiritual efforts and statistics; these are the core of your character. 
### Primary Attribute Traits 
These traits are the most broad, general overview of a character's abilities. Think of them as trunks of trees.

Primary Attribute traits are determined by choices during character creation. 
- ***Physicality*** governs physical prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for front-liners who expect to take heavy damage.
- ***Mentality*** governs mental prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for those who want to outsmart and outwit Behemoths.
- ***Spirituality*** governs the connection to one's self.
This trait is most important for those who expect to rely on magic and ranged weaponry. 
### Secondary Attribute Traits 
These traits are slightly more specialized, though they are still quite broad; think of these as the branches of a tree. 

Secondary Attribute traits are calculated quite easily; any given Secondary Attribute trait is an allocation of its governing Primary Attribute trait. For example, if a Breaker has ***Physicality*** 6, their **Strength** and **Agility** must add up to 6, in any manner desired, as long as both Secondary Attribute traits are **at least** 1. Remember: **Any given Secondary Attribute trait must be, at minimum, 1.**
#### Physical Secondaries
- **Strength** is a measure of one's gross motor control.
- **Agility** is a measure of one's fine motor control.
#### Mental Secondaries
- **Will** is a measure of mental strength.
- **Intellect** is a measure of mental dexterity.
#### Spiritual Secondaries
- **Connection** is a measure of how well one converses with others.
- **Soul** is a measure of how well one is aware of themself.
 
## Skill Traits 
Skill traits are the most "specialized" trait, though they still do not key themselves to one specific action. Think of these as the leaves and twigs on a tree's branch. 

Skill traits are gained by investing Skill Points (SP), up to a limit. This limit is equal to the governing Secondary Attribute trait, unless you are **Gifted** in that Skill.
>[!aside|right] 
>#### Being Gifted
>Each School allows a Breaker to be *gifted* in a small selection of Skill traits.  When you are Gifted in a Skill, your *maximum Skill Level* for that Skill is *doubled*. 
#### Physical Skills
##### Strength
- *Power* is a measure of one's raw bodily power.
- *Fortitude* is a measure of one's bodily fortitude.
##### Agility
- *Dexterity* is a measure of one's grace and manual coordination.
- *Speed* is a measure of one's speed and reaction time.
#### Mental Skills
##### Will
- *Observation*: Tertiary Trait; a measure of one's perceptions, both passive and active.
- *Resolve* is a measure of one's raw willpower.
##### Intellect 
- *Crafting* is a measure of one's ability to create practical things.
- *Memory* is a measure of how robust one's recall is.
#### Spiritual Skills
##### Connection
- *Appeal* is a measure of how one entertains and convinces others.
- *Portrayal* is a measure of how one carries themselves
##### Soul
- *Tenacity* is a measure of how powerful one's personality is.
- *Creativity* is a measure of how well one can create abstract things.
## Derived Traits 
Some traits are combinations of others; these are referred to as *derived* traits. These such traits are typically a combination of two or three traits, though specific details are given under each derived traits' entry below.
### Health 
In *Behemoth Breakers*, Health is divided into two distinct pools: *Mortal* Health and *Surface* Health. These are two independent pools, and are tracked separately, yet they still depend on one another. Occasionally, a rule will reference *Total* Health, which is exactly as it sounds: the summation of both Health pool types.
#### Mortal Health 
*Mortal* Health, referred to commonly as mHP, is a distinct measure of how much bodily damage a character can withstand before *dying*. *Mortal* Health damage is typically only dealt once a character's *Surface* Health has been depleted, though there are some Behemoth hazards and attacks that deal *Deadly* damage, which can *bypass* *Surface* Health! 

***The Math***
A Breaker's mHP is the result of **Physicality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Health**.
#### Surface Health
Unlike mHP, *Surface* Health (commonly abbreviated as sHP) is less a strict measure of physical ability and more-so a rationalization of near-misses, scrapes and grazes, luck, and combat constitution. Damage is typically done to sHP *first*, which is a great thing, considering Breakers have much more of it than they do mHP!

***The Math***
A Breaker's sHP is the result of **2**×**mHP**
#### Total Health
Total Health, or tHP, is just as it sounds; the total of both of a Breaker's Health pools. This trait is rarely referenced, but when it is, it is typically by *very* powerful effects, such as a Usurper-class Behemoth with the ability to *outright kill* low tHP Breakers. Scary stuff, man.

***The Math***
A Breaker's tHP is **mHP**+**sHP**.
### Stamina 
Stamina fuels a Breaker's more rigorous combat abilities, such as the Musketeer's **Perfect Shot** or the War Wheel's **Rev Roto-Engine**. Most Breakers have a fair amount of it, and it comes back pretty quickly; the rate at which it does so is called Stamina *Regeneration*.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Stamina is the result of **Physicality**+**Mentality**+**Base Stamina**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Stamina**/**2**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Mana 
Magic is not free, obviously, and as such, one needs a way to fuel it. That is where Mana comes into play. A Breaker's more *arcane* abilities, such as the Crusader's **Divine Light** cost Mana to use (and some, like the Shadow's **Shadowsneak**, even cost *both*.) Mana *also* regenerates on a per round basis, though at a much slower rate.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Mana is the result of **Mentality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Mana**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Mana**/**4**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Defenses 
The defenses, while still derived traits, work a little differently due to the fact that one of the traits that they are based upon is a die. When calculating these traits, the trait with the die indicates only the *value*, the other components of the trait will determine the *amount* of dice.
#### Dodge 
Dodging is the act of simply moving out of the way of an attack! There's much more to it than that, but that's the basics. When you see an attack coming, a well-timed dive, side-step, or even *lean* will get you out of the trajectory of a devastating blow.

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Dodge** dice pool is the result of (**Mentality**+**Spirituality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Dodge.
#### Block 
Blocking, unlike dodging, is *not* the act of moving out of the way of an attack. Instead, it is the act of *putting something between you and the danger.* Much more dangerous, yet much more rewarding as well!

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Block** dice pool is the result of (**Physicality**+**Mentality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Block.
### Move
**Move** is unique in terms of the derived traits in that it has a universal base value (or, at least for now it does) which is then adjusted depending on the Skill Level of a Breaker's *Speed* skill trait. 

***The Math***
For every **five** Skill Levels (*not* Points) a Breaker has in the *Speed* skill trait, they gain an additional +1 space to any Moves they have.
## Creation Overview 
Before you get started on making your first Breaker, make sure you're familiar with the three Traits sections above, then follow the steps as presented!
 
### Step 1. 
Select your Breaker's **Species**; this is what culture they belong to. Record your Base Health, Base Mana, and Base Stamina Derived traits, any abilities gained, and your bonuses to your Primary Attribute traits, on your Breaker sheet. Remember, all three Primary Attribute traits start at 2!
> [!cards]
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Humankind** are highly adaptable generalists that can fill any role on any time.
>
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Pillarad** are a strong and spiritual people that have a deep connection to the Uberwald.
> 
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Lo'darlyr** are ancient mana-driven golems constructed by the Apex and discovered by the Pillarad.
### Step 2. 
Select your Breaker's **Job**; this is the role they fill within the Company. After you make your selection, record any abilities gained and your Primary Attribute trait bonuses on your Breaker sheet. 
> [!cards|4]
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Master Smithy** holds the position of ensuring Breakers are armed and equipped for hunts.
>
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Head Researcher** ensures that Breakers are educated on their marks.
> 
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Entertainments Master** has the job of keeping the Company entertained.
>
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Retired Breaker** used to be knee-deep in the action, but took a backseat to new blood, and recently has been forced back into action. 

 
### Step 3. 
Select your Breaker's **School**; this is the methodology of Behemoth Hunting they are learned in. Make sure you record your Primary Attribute trait adjustments, as well as your School's abilities and actions, on your Breaker sheet. Be keen to mark your Gifted Skill traits, too!
>[!cards]
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Raging Berserker** sits deep within a seat of rage to fight against all foes.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Peerless Shadow** sits in the bleak shadow to ensure a powerful, singular blow.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Tenacious Invoker** shapes mana into the wicked force of elementia itself.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Valiant Crusader** remains stalwart against the tide, healing and smiting with Divine Light.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Eagle-Eyed Musketeer** aims for the perfect, devastating shot.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Patient Caller** utilizes spirits to heal allies.
### Step 4. 
Select your Breaker's **Weapon**; this is the tool they use to hunt Behemoths. Make sure you have your Weapon Actions and mechanics handy, and that you record its Primary Attribute trait adjustments, Defenses, and base Weapon Damage die size. 
> [!cards]
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Heavy-Class Weapon: Cleaver-Scythe** allows for swift blows and devastating charged offense.
>
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**Agile-Class Weapon: Bomba Pistols** enables the user to stay evasive and mobile while also maintaining pressure offensively.
> 
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**Balance-Class Weapon: Breaker Fists** offer high speed and high damage at the cost of encouraging one to fly too close to the sun. 
### Step 5. 
Determine your Breaker's **Primary  Attribute Traits**, which are adjusted by the previous four choices. Remember, they begin at 2, and you add the adjustments to that. 
### Step 6. 
Determine your Breaker's **Secondary Attribute Traits**, which are allocated based off their Primary Traits. Each pair of Secondary Attribute traits *cannot* exceed its governing Primary Attribute trait, and it cannot be less than 1. 
### Step 7. 
Spend your 10 starting Skill Points (SP) on **Skill Traits**. Keep in mind that each Skill trait cannot exceed its governing Secondary Attribute trait, unless it is a  Gifted Skill trait, which have their limit *doubled.*
### Step 8. 
Calculate your **Health**, **Stamina**, **Mana**, **Dodge**, **Block** and **Move**. See each of these entries in the Traits section for information how to to calculate them. 
### Step 9. 
Use your starting budget of **crowns** to purchase equipment, including starting armor and weaponry.  For the sake of this playtest, this step is irrelevant, but it'll be featured in the next one!
### Step 10.
Finally, describe your Breaker's appearance, fill out their **biography**, and choose their **name** and **pronouns**!

## Schools 
All Breakers hunt Behemoths, but almost none of them will do it the exact same way as another. This *could* be due to choice of weaponry, or how many Breakers they prefer in their hunting party, but most commonly, these differences are simply due to the Breakers' *School.*

The Twelve Breaker Schools have twelve different origin stories, as well as twelve different combat methodologies and twelve different life philosophies. The only thing they share, however, is the burden of training some poor commoner to slay a massive, hulking beast from the Uberwald. This burden is an ancient one, and without the Schools fulfilling it, Behemoths surely would rule the world. 

The Breaker's League categorizes the Schools into three *Charters.* These Charters group the schools by the scant similarities in their methods and ideals. When selecting your School, keep in mind that these Charters have no mechanical impact, but *do* have quite the big impact in roleplay! The Charters love a good rivalry, even if they all share a common goal.
### The Ruby Drums Charter 
The first of the three Charters, the Ruby Drums are united under one idea: *"Might makes right."* Little else unites them; the in-fighting and rivalry amongst these Schools is second to none. 
#### School of the Raging Berserker
> [!statblocks|columns]
>
>> [!blank]  
>> ##### School of the Raging Berserker
>>> Embodying primal rage, thunderous passion and violent fury, Berserkers merciless hunt down Behemoths by straddling the line between lucidity and complete consumption. As the Behemoth wounds the Berserker, their anger grows, and as their anger grows, their strength does as well. It is here, in this space between life and death, that true anger can be found; the anger against the thought of dying.

### Heavy-Class Weaponry
These are the biggest of the Breaker Weapons, and for what they lack in maneuverability, they make up for in sheer might and/or blocking power. Breakers cannot effectively **Dodge** while equipped with a Heavy-class weapon, but in return, these Breakers can withstand almost any assault.

Unlike the other two classes of weaponry, the Balance-Class arsenal allows a Breaker to keep sway with by **Dodging**, but also hold the line by **Blocking**. One small caveat, however: they will not be as good at either of them! Balance-Class weapons are *balanced*, after all, not *biased*.

# Part 2: Feedback
Now that you've finished up with your playtest, head over to the provided feedback form and begin filling out the next two sections. Once you're done with that, you're done with this playtest! 
# Glossary 1: Tag List 
- **Block** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Blocking, and provides how that action changes the Block Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Block -2" is an action that lowers (-) Block Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Block +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
- **Charged** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag can have a number of *additional* actions spent on them in order to gain bonus effects, which are listed in the actions *Charged* section.  
- **Combo** Actions with this tag are typically done in sequence. After performing a *Combo* action, your *Combo Count* increases by 1. It further increments by 1 for each *Combo* action you take, and resets to 0 when you take an action without this tag.
- **Combo-Breaker** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cannot be used unless you have a *Combo Count* equal to or higher than the qualifier. 
- **Dodge** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Dodging, and provides how that action changes the Dodge Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Dodge -2" is an action that lowers (-) Dodge Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Dodge +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
- **Drawing** Actions with this tag allow the user to draw the weapon they plan on using the action with as part of it, forgoing the need to **Sheathe**.
- **Flourish** Actions with this tag can only be performed once per turn. 
- **Limited** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag can only be used a number of times per engagement. The number of uses is given in the qualifier.
- **Mana** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost mana to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
- **Move** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this trait allow the user to move as part of the action, up to a number of spaces given in the qualifier. *This is a type tag.*
- **Open** An action with this tag can only be used if its the first action of that type you take on your turn. The *type* tags are: Strike, Move, Dodge and Block. 
- **Piercing** *Strike* actions with this tag ignore half of a Behemoth's applicable Resistances.
- **Reach** This tag always has a qualifier. *Strike* actions with this tag have their effective targeting area (or reach) increased by the qualifier.
- **Riposte** This tag always has a qualifier, and always is accompanied by the *Block* tag. Actions with this tag allow a counterattack after successfully blocking an attack. This counterattack can be any *Strike* action that requires a number of actions given in the qualifier (that you could otherwise perform.)
- **Stamina** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost stamina to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
- **Strike** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves making an attack, and provides how that action changes the Damage Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Strike -2" is an attack that lowers (-) Damage Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Strike +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered *attacks*. *This is a type tag.*
- **Stunning** *Strike* actions with this tag increase their Weapon Die size by 1 step when dealing damage to a Behemoth's Head (or equivalent.)
# Conclusion
I'd like to thank you for your time, and I sincerely hope you had fun. If you didn't, then I apologize. Make sure you tell me why; that's how I improve the game! 

I look forward you participating in the next playtest, should you decide to do so. 

Remember hunters, the *Uberwald needs to be tamed, and only the Breakers can do it.*
