## Traits 
"*Trait*" is the catch-all term for any numerical component of a character. Their main function is to act a modifier to a **Target Number** when making a test. *Derived* traits, which are described below, are an exception to this. 
### Primary Attribute Traits 
These traits are the most broad, general overview of a character's abilities. Think of them as trunks of trees.

Primary Attribute traits are determined by choices during character creation. 
- ***Physicality*** governs physical prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for front-liners who expect to take heavy damage.
- ***Mentality*** governs mental prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for those who want to outsmart and outwit Behemoths.
- ***Spirituality*** governs the connection to one's self.
This trait is most important for those who expect to rely on magic and ranged weaponry. 
### Secondary Attribute Traits 
These traits are slightly more specialized, though they are still quite broad; think of these as the branches of a tree. 

Secondary Attribute traits are calculated quite easily; any given Secondary Attribute trait is an allocation of its governing Primary Attribute trait. For example, if a Breaker has ***Physicality*** 6, their **Strength** and **Agility** must add up to 6, in any manner desired, as long as both Secondary Attribute traits are **at least** 1. Remember: **Any given Secondary Attribute trait must be, at minimum, 1.**
#### Physical Secondaries
- **Strength** is a measure of one's gross motor control.
- **Agility** is a measure of one's fine motor control.
#### Mental Secondaries
- **Will** is a measure of mental strength.
- **Intellect** is a measure of mental dexterity.
#### Spiritual Secondaries
- **Connection** is a measure of how well one converses with others.
- **Soul** is a measure of how well one is aware of themself.
### Skill Traits
Skill traits are the most "specialized" trait, though they still do not key themselves to one specific action. Think of these as the leaves and twigs on a tree's branch. 

In order to calculate a Skill trait, 
>[!aside|right] 
>#### Being Gifted
>Each School allows a Breaker to be *gifted* in a small selection of Skill traits.  When you are Gifted in a Skill, your *maximum Skill Level* for that Skill is *doubled*. 
#### Physical Skills
- *Power* is a measure of one's raw bodily power.
- *Fortitude* is a measure of one's bodily fortitude.
- *Dexterity* is a measure of one's grace and manual coordination.
- *Speed* is a measure of one's speed and reaction time.
#### Mental Skills
- *Observation*: Tertiary Trait; a measure of one's perceptions, both passive and active.
- *Resolve* is a measure of one's raw willpower.
- *Crafting* is a measure of one's ability to create practical things.
- *Memory* is a measure of how robust one's recall is.
#### Spiritual Skills
- *Appeal* is a measure of how one entertains and convinces others.
- *Portrayal* is a measure of how one carries themselves
- *Tenacity* is a measure of how powerful one's personality is.
- *Creativity* is a measure of how well one can create abstract things.
## Derived Traits 
Some traits are combinations of others; these are referred to as *derived* traits. These such traits are typically a combination of two or three traits, though specific details are given under each derived traits' entry below.
### Health 
In *Behemoth Breakers*, Health is divided into two distinct pools: *Mortal* Health and *Surface* Health. These are two independent pools, and are tracked separately, yet they still depend on one another. Occasionally, a rule will reference *Total* Health, which is exactly as it sounds: the summation of both Health pool types.
#### Mortal Health 
*Mortal* Health, referred to commonly as mHP, is a distinct measure of how much bodily damage a character can withstand before *dying*. *Mortal* Health damage is typically only dealt once a character's *Surface* Health has been depleted, though there are some Behemoth hazards and attacks that deal *Deadly* damage, which can *bypass* *Surface* Health! 

***The Math***
A Breaker's mHP is the result of **Physicality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Health**.
#### Surface Health
Unlike mHP, *Surface* Health (commonly abbreviated as sHP) is less a strict measure of physical ability and more-so a rationalization of near-misses, scrapes and grazes, luck, and combat constitution. Damage is typically done to sHP *first*, which is a great thing, considering Breakers have much more of it than they do mHP!

***The Math***
A Breaker's sHP is the result of **2**×**mHP**
#### Total Health
Total Health, or tHP, is just as it sounds; the total of both of a Breaker's Health pools. This trait is rarely referenced, but when it is, it is typically by *very* powerful effects, such as a Usurper-class Behemoth with the ability to *outright kill* low tHP Breakers. Scary stuff, man.

***The Math***
A Breaker's tHP is **mHP**+**sHP**.
### Stamina 
Stamina fuels a Breaker's more rigorous combat abilities, such as the Musketeer's **Perfect Shot** or the War Wheel's **Rev Roto-Engine**. Most Breakers have a fair amount of it, and it comes back pretty quickly; the rate at which it does so is called Stamina *Regeneration*.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Stamina is the result of **Physicality**+**Mentality**+**Base Stamina**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Stamina**/**2**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Mana 
Magic is not free, obviously, and as such, one needs a way to fuel it. That is where Mana comes into play. A Breaker's more *arcane* abilities, such as the Crusader's **Divine Light** cost Mana to use (and some, like the Shadow's **Shadowsneak**, even cost *both*.) Mana *also* regenerates on a per round basis, though at a much slower rate.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Mana is the result of **Mentality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Mana**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Mana**/**4**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Defenses 
The defenses, while still derived traits, work a little differently due to the fact that one of the traits that they are based upon is a die. When calculating these traits, the trait with the die indicates only the *value*, the other components of the trait will determine the *amount* of dice.
#### Dodge 
Dodging is the act of simply moving out of the way of an attack! There's much more to it than that, but that's the basics. When you see an attack coming, a well-timed dive, side-step, or even *lean* will get you out of the trajectory of a devastating blow.

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Dodge** dice pool is the result of (**Mentality**+**Spirituality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Dodge.
#### Block 
Blocking, unlike dodging, is *not* the act of moving out of the way of an attack. Instead, it is the act of *putting something between you and the danger.* Much more dangerous, yet much more rewarding as well!

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Block** dice pool is the result of (**Physicality**+**Mentality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Block.
### Move
**Move** is unique in terms of the derived traits in that it has a universal base value (or, at least for now it does) which is then adjusted depending on the Skill Level of a Breaker's *Speed* skill trait. 

***The Math***
For every **five** Skill Levels (*not* Points) a Breaker has in the *Speed* skill trait, they gain an additional +5 feet to any Moves they have.
# Part 2: A Company of  Behemoth Breakers
## Before You Begin 
## Creating a Breaker
### Overview
1. Select your Breaker's **Species**; this is what culture they belong to.
2. Select your Breaker's **Job**; this is the role they fill within the Company.
3. Select your Breaker's **School**; this is the methodology of Behemoth Hunting they are learned in.
4. Select your Breaker's **Weapon**; this is the tool they use to hunt Behemoths. 
5. Determine your Breaker's **Primary  Attribute Traits**, which are adjusted by the previous four choices.
6. Determine your Breaker's **Secondary Attribute Traits**, which are allocated based off their Primary Traits.
7. Spend your starting Skill Points (SP) on **Skill Traits**.
8. Calculate your **Health**, **Stamina**, **Mana**, **Dodge**, **Block** and **Move**. 
9. Use your starting budget of **crowns** to purchase equipment, including starting armor and weaponry.
10. Finally, describe your Breaker's appearance, fill out their **biography**, and choose their **name** and **pronouns**!
## The Company 
In *Behemoth Breakers*, Breakers never act alone. They are always part of a greater group, which consists of people who can provide what they need to be successful during the hunt. These groups are called *Companies,* and it is these Companies that venture out into the Uberwald to hunt Behemoths and usurp territory from the wilds. 
### Company Jobs
Each company varies in how many people it actually has, but each Company requires *eight* primary roles to be filled in order to function. These roles are listed here, and further expanded upon later.
 1. Head Researcher
 2. Master Smithy
 3. Quartermaster
 4. Master Chef
 5. Lead Apothecary
 6. Entertainments Master 
 7. Garrison Commander
 8. Prime Commissioner

### School 
All Breakers hunt Behemoths, but almost none of them will do it the exact same way as another. This *could* be due to choice of weaponry, or how many Breakers they prefer in their hunting party, but most commonly, these differences are simply due to the Breakers' *School.*

The Twelve Breaker Schools have twelve different origin stories, as well as twelve different combat methodologies and twelve different life philosophies. The only thing they share, however, is the burden of training some poor commoner to slay a massive, hulking beast from the Uberwald. This burden is an ancient one, and without the Schools fulfilling it, Behemoths surely would rule the world. 

The Breaker's League categorizes the Schools into three *Charters.* These Charters group the schools by the scant similarities in their methods and ideals. When selecting your School, keep in mind that these Charters have no mechanical impact, but *do* have quite the big impact in roleplay! The Charters love a good rivalry, even if they all share a common goal.
#### The Ruby Drums Charter 
The first of the three Charters, the Ruby Drums are united under one idea: *"Might makes right."* Little else unites them; the in-fighting and rivalry amongst these Schools is second to none. 
##### School of the Raging Berserker
> [!statblocks|columns]

>> [!blank]  
>> ##### School of the Raging Berserker
>>> Embodying primal rage, thunderous passion and violent fury, Berserkers merciless hunt down Behemoths by straddling the line between lucidity and complete consumption. As the Behemoth wounds the Berserker, their anger grows, and as their anger grows, their strength does as well. It is here, in this space between life and death, that true anger can be found; the anger against the thought of dying.

### Weaponry
>[!info]- Action Tags 1: The Glossary.
> Below is a small glossary of some important action tags, alongside their rules.
> - **Block** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Blocking, and provides how that action changes the Block Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Block -2" is an action that lowers (-) Block Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Block +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. 
> - **Charged** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag can have a number of *additional* actions spent on them in order to gain bonus effects, which are listed in the actions *Charged* section. 
> - **Combo** Actions with this tag are typically done in sequence, and the tag can have different effects depending on the weapon. 
> - **Drawing** Actions with this tag allow the user to draw the weapon they plan on using the action with as part of it, forgoing the need to **Draw a Weapon**.
> - **Move** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this trait allow the user to move as part of the action, up to a number of spaces given in the qualifier.
> - **Reach** This tag always has a qualifier. *Strike* actions with this tag have their effective targeting area (or reach) increased by the qualifier.
> - **Riposte** This tag always has a qualifier, and always is accompanied by the *Block* tag. Actions with this tag allow a counterattack after successfully blocking an attack. This counterattack can be any *Strike* action that requires a number of actions given in the qualifier (that you could otherwise perform.)
> - **Strike** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves making an attack, and provides how that action changes the Damage Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Strike -2" is an attack that lowers (-) Damage Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Strike +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. 

*How* a Breaker fights is defined by their School, but *what* they fight *with* is a different story entirely. That question is answered by what Breaker Weapon they use. These weapons are special-engineered to allow the much-smaller mortalkind Breakers to effectively deal with Behemoths. 

Each weapon is specialized to a certain style or method of hunting, which is what allows for the wide diversity of Breaker hunting styles despite there only being 12 Schools. 

These weapons are grouped by their similarities (with these categories being called *Weapon Classes*), which tends to primarily be weight and size. They are grouped this way due to these factors being what restricts a Breaker's Defenses. After all, a rolling Dodge is much easier with a small pair of Bomba Pistols than it is with a giant Cleaver-Scythe.
#### Heavy-Class Weaponry
These are the biggest of the Breaker Weapons, and for what they lack in maneuverability, they make up for in sheer might and/or blocking power. Breakers cannot effectively **Dodge** while equipped with a Heavy-class weapon, but in return, these Breakers can withstand almost any assault.
##### Cleaver-Scythe
> [!statblocks|columns 5]

>> ##### Cleaver-Scythe
>> ***Heavy-Class***
>> > A massive, cleaving scythe that utilizes a mana-driven momentum sink in order to greatly increase the swinging force of the weapon. This momentum sink can also be purged at will, allowing for the user to change directions mid-swing or even pivot into a blocking stance.

- War Needle
- Thunder Mallet: a massive maul that a Breaker can strike with a small beater to sound like a drum.
#### Agile-Class Weaponry
>[!info]- Qualifiers and You 
>Some 
While lacking in size (though not by much,) these Breaker Weapons are much more agile and mobile, allowing for the Breakers that use them to keep up high pressure while deftly avoiding damage. 

Breakers cannot **Block** while equipped with a Agile-Class weapon, but in return, they can avoid nearly any attack!
##### Bomba Pistols

>> ##### Bomba Pistols
>> ***Agile-Class***
>> > A pair of large percussion-driver pistols that utilize Behemoth Hide thumperdrums to increase power and penetration when fired rhythmically. Named for the style of dancing that the inventor of the weapon also invented.

>> Each pair of Bomba Pistols has a number of attacks that, when made in a single turn, cause the weapons' thumperdrums to resonate with mana. Meeting this condition is called being *On Pace,* which can activate certain conditions.
>> - **Bomba de Fuego!**
>> While you are *On Pace*, your Damage Die size increases by 1 and the Penetration value of all shot types increases by 1.

- Yo-Yo Wheel: a massive wheel, bound to a cord and handle that allows the user to open up the wheel, exposing massive blades.
	- Mechanic: 
		- Roto-Engine- Landing a successful attack in Blunt form excites the wheel, increasing rotational force. Landing another attack, this time in Bladed form, preserves momentum. Continued alternating attacks allows for this increased damage to be preserved. 
- Bow-Blades: A pair of large, curved blades that can open up, then combine, into a powerful, yet short-ranged bow.
	- Mechanic: 
		- String Resonance- Attacks in blade form build resonance, which can be vented by firing arrows in bow form. Higher resonance=more arrow damage, and at max resonance, firing the bow consumes no mana.
- Bomba Pistols: 
	- Mechanic: 
		- Dancing Pace- Each pair of pistols has a *Dancing Pace.* Making a number of attacks each turn equal to the weapon's *Dancing Pace* resonates the weapon, boosting Weapon Damage and Penetration.
- Blade-Harp: A long, flat blade which acts as a sounding board for strings that run across the length of the blade. As the user swings, air rushes through the weapon, acting like an Aeolian harp. These tones are controlled by triggers on the hilt.
	- Mechanics 
		- Bladesong-"Inner Fire": After playing the correct sequence of notes, the user bolsters their Dodge defense and increases their attack speed. Also increases Weapon Damage for each buff currently active on allies. 
		- Bladesong-"Breaker's Aria": After playing the correct sequence of notes, the user grants a buff to their allies for a small duration. 
#### Balance-Class Weaponry
Unlike the other two classes of weaponry, the Balance-Class arsenal allows a Breaker to keep sway with by **Dodging**, but also hold the line by **Blocking**. One small caveat, however: they will not be as good at either of them! Balance-Class weapons are *balanced*, after all, not *biased*. 

- Breaker Fists: A pair of large gauntlets that sport spikes or claws, with large plates for blocking and boosters in the hands for acceleration.
	- Mechanics
		- Claw/Pummel Stance: Breakers can swap between Severing and Impact damage at will. 
		- Accel Boosters: Breakers can burn mana to engage the boosters in the weapon, providing powerful acceleration speeds. Additionally, after using an Accel maneuver, the Fists' gain momentum, increasing Penetration or Impact power.
- Change-Revolver: a large revolver-style rifle that can be reconfigured between a long-range, high-powered sniper form and a short-range, high fire-rate form.
	- Mechanics
		- Sniper Configuration:
		- Riot Configuration: 
		- Shot Types: 
- Roulette-Rang: A six-sided boomerang that randomizes its damage types and elemental affinities. The user can burn mana to "lock in" a damage type, increasing both weapon damage and blocking potency against that damage type.
