		- Thunder Mallet 
		- Coffin-blade
	- Agile-Class Weaponry
		- Yo-Yo Wheel: a massive wheel, bound to a cord and handle that allows the user to open up the wheel, exposing massive blades.
			- Mechanic: 
			- Roto-Engine- Landing a successful attack in Blunt form excites the wheel, increasing rotational force. Landing another attack, this time in Bladed form, preserves momentum. Continued alternating attacks allows for this increased damage to be preserved. 
		- Bow-Blades: A pair of large, curved blades that can open up, then combine, into a powerful, yet short-ranged bow.
			- Mechanic: 
				- String Resonance- Attacks in blade form build resonance, which can be vented by firing arrows in bow form. Higher resonance=more arrow damage, and at max resonance, firing the bow consumes no mana.
		- Blade-Harp: A long, flat blade which acts as a sounding board for strings that run across the length of the blade. As the user swings, air rushes through the weapon, acting like an Aeolian harp. These tones are controlled by triggers on the hilt.
			- Mechanics 
				- Bladesong-"Inner Fire": After playing the correct sequence of notes, the user bolsters their Dodge defense and increases their attack speed. Also increases Weapon Damage for each buff currently active on allies. 
				- Bladesong-"Breaker's Aria": After playing the correct sequence of notes, the user grants a buff to their allies for a small duration. 
	- Balance-Class Weaponry
		- Change-Revolver: a large revolver-style rifle that can be reconfigured between a long-range, high-powered sniper form and a short-range, high fire-rate form.
			- Mechanics
				- Sniper Configuration:
				- Riot Configuration: 
				- Shot Types: 
		- Roulette-Rang: A six-sided boomerang that randomizes its damage types and elemental affinities. The user can burn mana to "lock in" a damage type, increasing both weapon damage and blocking potency against that damage type.
