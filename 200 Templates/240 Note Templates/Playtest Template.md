# Introduction
## Goals 
## Game Materials
In order to play this playtest, you'll need a few things, which are listed here:
- Either (or both):
	- A set of dice, d2 through d20, with 2 additional d6 (for a total of 3d6) 
	- A digital dice roller. While less fun, digital dice make playing the game much easier.
- Basic reading comprehension. 
- [The Official Behemoth Breaker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n2CYNY7mnI1LOLS1rMADno1L36xFq9Jyu9224PD4lhM/edit?usp=sharing) character sheet. It does most of the math for you, just to save us all some time.
- [Your Feedback Form]()
- Some scratch paper or a notepad document to take notes as you do the playtest.
- About 30-45 minutes of free time.
## Instructions
*Disclaimer:* If you do not intend to complete the playtest as written, then I would prefer for you to simply not participate. The instructions are given in the manner that they are in order to glean required development information, and forgoing parts of the playtest skews the data and can invalidate feedback and your experience.
# Conclusion
I'd like to thank you for your time, and I sincerely hope you had fun. If you didn't, then I apologize!
Make sure you tell me why; that's how I improve the game! 

I look forward you participating in the next playtest, should you decide to do so. 

Remember hunters, the *Uberwald needs to be tamed, and only a Company of Behemoth Breakers can do it.*
