## Game Materials
In order to play this game, you'll need a few things, which are listed here:
- Either:
	- A writing utensil, preferably a pencil, and the paper Breaker Sheet, or;
	- The digital Breaker sheet. 
- Either (or both):
	- A set of dice, d2 through d20, with 2 additional d6 (for a total of 3d6) 
	- A digital dice roller. While less fun, digital dice make playing the game much easier.
- Basic reading comprehension. 
- A group of 5-7 people (4-6 Breakers, 1 Fable-Maker.)
- 2-4 hours (or more) per session.
- A willingness to have fun.
## The Players 
While everyone involved in playing the game are players, this game uses that term, alongside "Breaker", to refer to the table members that are *not* the Fable-Maker. 

Before the story begins, the players come together to craft a shared history; how their Breakers came to know one another, how their Company was founded, and what its goal is are all details that the group needs to pin down, but also things like individual strengths and weaknesses! 

The Fable-Maker is free to impose creative or mechanical limits on character creation, though commonly they either will not do this or will have a strong reason for it. 

As for the flow of play, the Breakers tell the Fable-Maker what they want to do and they determine the outcome and adjudicate rules around these actions. There is no "right" way to do this; some like to act out what their characters are doing (this is roleplaying) and others like to describe the action via what is referred to as narration. Do what you feel is best and what your table agrees on, but NEVER force someone into playing in a manner that isn't fun. 

If this is your first time with a table-top roleplaying game, I recommend you take on the role of player, and I also would like to thank you for letting this silly game of mine be your first time of hopefully many.
## The Fable-Maker
If the Breakers are in charge of one singular entity within the game world, the Fable-Maker is responsible for *everything else.* The story, the world, everything. All of it. They describe the adventure, the politics and the hunting. They also portray non-player characters in order to weave the narrative and ensure the world reacts to the players' actions. 

Fable-Makers use the rules in *Book 2, The Fable-Maker*.

Fable-Makers are free to craft their own adventures, but there is also one provided in this book, as well as published adventures and third-party ones online!

Being a Fable-Maker is *hard.* It requires you to be able to plan ahead, adjust on the fly, narrate a story, swap characters on a moment's notice, and adjudicate the rules of the game. But! It is also deeply rewarding and very much worth the hard work required to run a great game. If you choose to become a Fable-Maker, just keep in mind that the only real thing that matters is that you and your players had fun. The rest falls into place with the honing of time. 
# *Book 1: The Behemoth Breaker* 
This book is for the players; it contains all the rules needed to make a Breaker and their Company.
# Part 1: Rules Of Play

>With food, friends, and a story, there is nothing one could ever deem "impossible."

Now that you've seen who and what you'll need, read forth, for the rules to forge your Breaker and their Company await.
## The Common Vernacular
Before you start reading rules, we need to all be on the same page about the language being used here. While most readers are likely well-acquitted with the vernacular of "roll to hit", "nat 20" and "NPC", maybe you, dear Breaker, are not. If so, this section is for you. We'll go over some common terms that you'll need to know now.

"Roll" means to literally (or virtually) roll a die, singular, (or dice, plural) across the table, down the tower (search "dice tower" on the internet, then curse me for a new obsession) or onto the pad. 

A "natural" result of a die means JUST the roll. A natural or "nat" 20 on a d20 is the die itself showing a 20, without any rules alterations. 

"Character", specifically in the terms of "Player Character" and "Non-Player Character", refers to entities within the game-space. Anytime this game refers to "characters", it encompasses anything with a testable statistic. "Player Characters" are who you, the players, play as, and "Non-Player Characters" are literally everything else. Simple!

Finally, "spaces". This game's world (or *setting*) doesn't have modern measurement units, but learning a whole new system is a big ask, so the game does some one way math for you. One "space", which is 1 square on a grid, is equal to 5 feet. Keep this in mind if you ever want to do the math to figure out how many miles-per-hour that uber-fast Breaker Fist build can throw itself at the nearest soon-to-be-inconvenienced Behemoth. 

These are the very basics of the "rulespeech" this game uses. Your vocabulary will be expanded as you read more, but like any new language, you must be willing to speak it! This metaphor is close to breaking down, so lets move on.
## The Math Stands Alone
"Basic arithmetic" was listed as a material you'd need to play this game, so lets explain what we mean by that. 

The four basic operations of math &mdash; multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction &mdash; are used throughout this game's rules. This is done because of one of the central design tenets of this game: it will never be simple for the sake of simplicity. The math required is not complex, but to boil the game down past it would compromise on the intent of the game. That being said, there are some rules to follow.
- Always round down. This is not how standard math works. I apologize. I have not the mathematics skills to balance the game in such a manner where this is not required.
- Follow the order of operations.
- Specific beats general. If a trait tells you to add, but a Perk tells you to multiply, then you multiply!
## The Dice 
Dice are a core part of any dice-driven TTRPG, and *Behemoth Breakers* is no different! For this game, you'll need a full range of dice (d2 through d20), *as well* as some method of virtual dice-rolling. This recommendation is given under the assumption that you do not have access to more obscure dice sizes; if you do, roll them! 

The way that this game most commonly interacts with dice is in the form of *changing sizes.* When an affect refers to increasing or decreasing a die size, it is in reference to the following track. In order to find the adjustment, begin with the *base* die size, then go right the number of indicated steps to find the increased size, or go left to find the decreased size. 

**d2-d4-d6-d8-d10-d12-d14-d16-d18-d20**

The most common die used for this game is the **d6**, as any check (referred to as *tests*) uses a pool of **3d6**. In case you are unfamiliar, that "3" refers to the amount of die you need; three individual six-sided dice.

This vernacular is important to understanding the game's referential shorthand; take time to make sure you understand it. For a working example, how many dice does one need to roll 2d12+3d4? 
## The Art of the Test
When something is left to chance, dice need to be involved; if you find yourself asking "can my Breaker jump that gap?" then you need to roll for it!

These rolls are called *tests*, and they are done with 3d6. 
For the question above, your Fable-Maker would tell you: "Lets see if you can. Make an *easy* *Dexterity* test." 

Then, you'd take your dice, roll them, and compare them to the *target number* (TN.) In order to calculate the TN, you'll need to understand two things: *difficulty* and *modifiers*.
### Difficulty Levels
In our example, your Fable-Maker declared that it was an "*easy*" test. What does this mean, exactly?

In *Behemoth Breakers*, the difficulty of a test is what determines the base number that one needs to roll under in order to succeed the test. Below is a chart explains the base TN for each difficulty level.

| Difficulty Level | Target Number |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|
|     Trivial      |         16         |
|    Very Easy     |         14         |
|       Easy       |         12         |
|     Average      |         10         |
|       Hard       |         8          |
|    Very Hard     |         6          |
|     Extreme      |         4          |

To answer the current question: an *easy* Dexterity test has a TN of 12, *before modifiers.* Now, all you need to know is what a modifier is.
### Modifiers: The Good, The Bad, and The Stacking
At their most basic, attribute and skill traits are just modifiers. They are modifiers that are added to a target number when making a test. This allows two different characters to have different chances of success and failure, or strengths and weaknesses! 

There are other kinds of modifiers, though, and they all have *types*. *Trait* is a kind of modifier, alongside *circumstance*, *item*, and *status.*

Trait modifiers (which will always be positive) are due to a specific trait's value being applied to that test as a modifier. 

Circumstance modifiers are incurred due to environment and conditions.

Item modifiers are due to one's equipment.

Status modifiers are incurred via abilities and magical effects. 

Positive modifiers are known as *bonuses*, while negative modifiers are called *penalties.* Any two bonuses or penalties of the *same* type do not stack, unless specifically mentioned; in the case of multiple, non-stacking modifiers of the same type, you always use the highest bonuses and lowest penalties. Modifiers of different types *always* stack together.

To put it all together in the game's shorthand, a "-1 *item penalty* to **Agility**" is a -1 item-type modifier to any **Agility** test (this includes Skill traits under **Agility**; modifiers "trickle down" so to speak.)

Lets apply this to our running example. Say for example your Breaker has *Dexterity* 4, and you've got a -1 *item penalty* to **Agility**.  Since you're making an *easy* *Dexterity* test, your base TN is 12. Then, you add your *Dexterity*, which is 4, giving you 16. Then, subtract the -1 penalty, for a final TN of 15. Roll 3d6, and add the results. You get a 14...success! You manage to clear the gap, jumping to the other side.

After the first few tests, it won't be this time consuming; you'll commit things to memory, find shortcuts, and get it all down-pat in no time at all.
### Critical Success and Failure
Sometimes, you succeed in a radical manner; you perfectly ace the landing as you leap from one side to the other. This occurs when your 3d6 roll totals 3 or 4. This is called a critical success.

The opposite of this can also occur when your roll totals 17 or 18. This, in turn, is called a critical failure, and it happens regardless of the target number; there is always a chance of circumstantial failure. Remember, the dice are not the measure of your ability, the TN is! 

What happens as a result of a critical outcome depends on the situation and is commonly left up to Fable-Maker interpretation. 
### Mortal Combat !
This next section will explain the fundamentals of making the two forms of combat rolls that are essential to this game. Unlike most games, accuracy is not in question when up against a Behemoth; Breakers simply attack. The variance, the drama, comes in how the defender reacts! 
#### On the Attack !
As mentioned, attacking works a little differently in *Behemoth Breakers* than it does in most other games; a test of accuracy is not performed when making an attack. Breakers are skilled, trained hunters of massive creatures; *if* they can hit it is not in question, but rather whether or not their mark can avoid or sustain the damage *is*. 

In order to make an attack, you'll need to understand your Damage Die for that action. This will be explained later, but the long-of-the-short is this medium(ish)-length drabble: every weapon has a Damage Die that is altered in size by the *Strike* action (or attack) being performed. 

Once you know the Damage Die size, as well as how many you're rolling, you have successfully found the Damage Dice Pool for this attack. You then roll these dice, and add the values together. This is the *Damage Dealt* by that attack. 

Keep in mind: this works the exact same way for Behemoths. 

Lets do an example. For this attack, the Behemoth you're fighting targets you, and then rolls 2d8 cutting damage., which shows a 6 and a 5. Adding these together, the Behemoth gets a *Damage Dealt* of 11!
#### Defense Defense Defense !
Now that damage has been rolled, you must defend! There are *two* Active Defenses, which are **Dodge** and **Block**. When making your defense, take your pick of the litter. Some weapons are better at one or the other, and some do both well. 

Just like with an attack, in order to Defend, you need to find a total dice pool, then roll it. In order to do that, find your weapon's base Defense die for the option you chose. For the sake of example, lets say you're **Blocking**, your weapon gives you a d10, and the action you're using doesn't change the die. Now, armed with the die size, you find the amount of that die. For this example, we'll say you get 2d10 to defend with. This is your Defense Dice Pool for this action!

You then roll your dice, which show a 7 and a 2, for a total of 9. This is the *Damage Defended* for this action! You then subtract the *Damage Defended* from the *Damage Dealt,* or in this case, 11 minus 9. This equals 2 cutting damage. 

Now that you've *actively* defended, your *passive* defenses are now applied. These are your **Resistances**, which are explained in more detail later on, in the Armor section, but they act as "flat" damage reduction, which just means you subtract your Resistance from the leftover damage. In this case, we'll say you **Resist** 1 cut damage, leaving you taking a paltry 1 cut damage. 

You mark 1 damage on your Breaker sheet, then keep going with the combat.
##### Combat Success and Failure 
Despite a lack of test in combat, *Strike* and *Defense* actions still have a measure of success, just like tests. 

An attack that deal *no* damage to its target is considered a failed attack, while an attack that deals *any* damage is a successful attack. Any attack that deals maximum possible damage (the highest number on every die in the pool) is a critical success (or *critical hit*)! Meanwhile, any attack that deals the minimum possible damage is a critical failure (or *critical blunder*). 

Defenses work similarly; any defense that allows any damage through (before Resistances) is a failed defense (commonly referred to as a *Partial* defense), while any defense that allows *no* damage through (before Resistances) is a successful defense (and this is commonly referred to as a *Complete* defense.) A defense in which all dice in the pool show their highest numbers is a critical success (or a *Perfect* defense), while a defense in which all dice show their lowest numbers is a critical failure (or a *Pathetic* defense).
###### Unconquerable!
Sometimes, the dice align in a manner where, even with a Perfect defense and all of a character's Resistances, they could not prevent all of the damage. Commonly, this signals a powerful attack! However, sometimes, this situation arises *and* the attack itself is a critical hit. When all of these circumstances align, that attack is what is known as *Unconquerable*. 

When an attack is Unconquerable, you might assume there is no use in defending, but there is a hope: if you achieve a Perfect defense against an Unconquerable attack, you negate *all* damage, regardless of circumstance.
## Attribute and Skill Traits 
"*Trait*" is the catch-all term for any numerical component of a character. Their main function is to act a modifier to a **Target Number** when making a test. *Derived* traits, which are described below, are an exception to this. 
### Primary Attribute Traits 
These traits are the most broad, general overview of a character's abilities. Think of them as trunks of trees.

Primary Attribute traits are determined by choices during character creation. 
- ***Physicality*** governs physical prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for front-liners who expect to take heavy damage.
- ***Mentality*** governs mental prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for those who want to outsmart and outwit Behemoths.
- ***Spirituality*** governs the connection to one's self.
This trait is most important for those who expect to rely on magic and ranged weaponry. 
### Secondary Attribute Traits 
These traits are slightly more specialized, though they are still quite broad; think of these as the branches of a tree. 

Secondary Attribute traits are calculated quite easily; any given Secondary Attribute trait is an allocation of its governing Primary Attribute trait. For example, if a Breaker has ***Physicality*** 6, their **Strength** and **Agility** must add up to 6, in any manner desired, as long as both Secondary Attribute traits are **at least** 1. Remember: **Any given Secondary Attribute trait must be, at minimum, 1.**
#### Physical Secondaries
- **Strength** is a measure of one's gross motor control.
- **Agility** is a measure of one's fine motor control.
#### Mental Secondaries
- **Will** is a measure of mental strength.
- **Intellect** is a measure of mental dexterity.
#### Spiritual Secondaries
- **Connection** is a measure of how well one converses with others.
- **Soul** is a measure of how well one is aware of themself.
### Skill Traits
Skill traits are the most "specialized" trait, though they still do not key themselves to one specific action. Think of these as the leaves and twigs on a tree's branch. 

In order to calculate a Skill trait, 
>[!aside|right] 
>#### Being Gifted
>Each School allows a Breaker to be *gifted* in a small selection of Skill traits.  When you are Gifted in a Skill, your *maximum Skill Level* for that Skill is *doubled*. 
#### Physical Skills
- *Power* is a measure of one's raw bodily power.
- *Fortitude* is a measure of one's bodily fortitude.
- *Dexterity* is a measure of one's grace and manual coordination.
- *Speed* is a measure of one's speed and reaction time.
#### Mental Skills
- *Observation*: Tertiary Trait; a measure of one's perceptions, both passive and active.
- *Resolve* is a measure of one's raw willpower.
- *Crafting* is a measure of one's ability to create practical things.
- *Memory* is a measure of how robust one's recall is.
#### Spiritual Skills
- *Appeal* is a measure of how one entertains and convinces others.
- *Portrayal* is a measure of how one carries themselves
- *Tenacity* is a measure of how powerful one's personality is.
- *Creativity* is a measure of how well one can create abstract things.
## Derived Traits 
Some traits are combinations of others; these are referred to as *derived* traits. These such traits are typically a combination of two or three traits, though specific details are given under each derived traits' entry below.
### Health 
In *Behemoth Breakers*, Health is divided into two distinct pools: *Mortal* Health and *Surface* Health. These are two independent pools, and are tracked separately, yet they still depend on one another. Occasionally, a rule will reference *Total* Health, which is exactly as it sounds: the summation of both Health pool types.
#### Mortal Health 
*Mortal* Health, referred to commonly as mHP, is a distinct measure of how much bodily damage a character can withstand before *dying*. *Mortal* Health damage is typically only dealt once a character's *Surface* Health has been depleted, though there are some Behemoth hazards and attacks that deal *Deadly* damage, which can *bypass* *Surface* Health! 

***The Math***
A Breaker's mHP is the result of **Physicality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Health**.
#### Surface Health
Unlike mHP, *Surface* Health (commonly abbreviated as sHP) is less a strict measure of physical ability and more-so a rationalization of near-misses, scrapes and grazes, luck, and combat constitution. Damage is typically done to sHP *first*, which is a great thing, considering Breakers have much more of it than they do mHP!

***The Math***
A Breaker's sHP is the result of **2**×**mHP**
#### Total Health
Total Health, or tHP, is just as it sounds; the total of both of a Breaker's Health pools. This trait is rarely referenced, but when it is, it is typically by *very* powerful effects, such as a Usurper-class Behemoth with the ability to *outright kill* low tHP Breakers. Scary stuff, man.

***The Math***
A Breaker's tHP is **mHP**+**sHP**.
### Stamina 
Stamina fuels a Breaker's more rigorous combat abilities, such as the Musketeer's **Perfect Shot** or the War Wheel's **Rev Roto-Engine**. Most Breakers have a fair amount of it, and it comes back pretty quickly; the rate at which it does so is called Stamina *Regeneration*.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Stamina is the result of **Physicality**+**Mentality**+**Base Stamina**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Stamina**/**2**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Mana 
Magic is not free, obviously, and as such, one needs a way to fuel it. That is where Mana comes into play. A Breaker's more *arcane* abilities, such as the Crusader's **Divine Light** cost Mana to use (and some, like the Shadow's **Shadowsneak**, even cost *both*.) Mana *also* regenerates on a per round basis, though at a much slower rate.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Mana is the result of **Mentality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Mana**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Mana**/**4**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Base Weapon Damage
All weapons deal damage! Shocker. 

Previously, a *Weapon Damage Die Pool* was mentioned. This section explains how to assemble that pool with much more depth than that example did.
#### Base Damage Die Size 
Die size is dependent on two factors: the weapon itself, and the action being performed. We're finding our starting point, however, so actions are not factored in here. 

Your Base Damage Die Size is found in your **Weapon**'s data entry.
#### Base Damage Die Amount 
The amount of dice in your Weapon Damage is dependent on your Tier. See the chart below.

|    Tiers     | Value |
|:------------:|:-----:|
|    Novice    |   1   |
|  Journeyman  |   2   |
|    Adept     |   3   |
| Professional |   4   |

#### Damage Types
Much like **Resistances**, Damage Types are separated into categories called **Physical** and **Elemental**. Within these, there are *base* damage types and *combined* damage types. Combined damage types *combine* the aspects of two (or more) base types, and are thus affected by anything that would affect any of its constituents.
##### Physical Damage Types 
All of these damage types are affected by **Physical Resistance**.
###### Base Types 
- Cutting (cut) damage can sever Behemoth parts such as tails.
- Crushing (cr) damage can knock out Behemoths when applied to the head, and break off horns and armor plates.
- Piercing (pi) damage can push past Behemoth armor and deals extra damage to Behemoth constructs.
###### Combined Damage Types
- Maiming (ma) is a combination of: *crushing* and *cutting*.
- Impaling (imp) is a combination of: *crushing* and *piercing*.
- Shredding (shr) is a combination of: *crushing* and *piercing*.
##### Elemental Damage Types
All of these damage types are affected by **Elemental Resistance**.
###### Base Types 
- Fire (fi) damage can ignite Behemoths and their constructs.
- Water (wr) damage can wash off protective Behemoth secretions.
- Earthen (eth) damage pummels Behemoths, weakening its armor.
- Air (air) damage lacerates the Behemoth, allowing for more part damage.
- Light (lig) damage enshrouds Behemoths, stopping stealth maneuvers and permitting better tracking.
- Dark (dar) damage dampens Behemoth elemental ability. 
###### Combined Damage Types
There are no combined Elemental damage types at this time. 
### Defenses 
Mentioned earlier was the idea of *defenses.* Like most other things, they too are a type of trait. Wild, right? Defenses specifically help you avoid injury, either *actively* in the form of **Blocking** and **Dodging**, or   *passively* in the form of **Resistances**. 
#### Active Defenses
The active defenses, while still derived traits, work a little differently due to the fact that one of the traits that they are based upon is a die. When calculating these traits, the trait with the die indicates only the *value*, the other components of the trait will determine the *amount* of dice.
##### Dodge 
Dodging is the act of simply moving out of the way of an attack! There's much more to it than that, but that's the basics. When you see an attack coming, a well-timed dive, side-step, or even *lean* will get you out of the trajectory of a devastating blow.

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Dodge** dice pool is the result of (**Mentality**+**Spirituality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Dodge.
##### Block 
Blocking, unlike dodging, is *not* the act of moving out of the way of an attack. Instead, it is the act of *putting something between you and the danger.* Much more dangerous, yet much more rewarding as well!

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Block** dice pool is the result of (**Physicality**+**Mentality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Block.
#### Passive Defense
There is only one type of Passive Defense, which is **Resistance**. Resistance comes in two forms, or subtypes: *Physical* **Resistance**, which prevents a portion of all **Physical** damage, and *Elemental* **Resistance**, which prevents a portion of all **Elemental** damage. Pretty simple. 
##### Resistances
Both types of Resistances are simply the sum of the **Resistance** values given by all of your equipped armor, and occasionally, equipment. Some abilities will also give **Resistances**.
### Size 
Size is simple. It tells you how many spaces your character takes up at its widest edge. Size is most commonly 1, which is just 1 space, but Size 2 would mean you instead take up a 2x2 square of spaces (or 4 spaces.) Size 3 would be a 3x3 (9 spaces), and so on and so forth. Size 0 and lower means you do not actively take up a whole space; Size 0 takes up half a space, -1 takes up a fourth, so on and so forth. 
### Move
**Move** is simply how far you can move during your turn; it is highly dependent on Size and the *Speed* Skill trait. Typically, a Breaker will only have a *Ground* **Move**, but some other options will give new types of Move. These are calculated the same way, unless stated otherwise. Remember, specific beats general. 

***The Math***
A Breaker's starting Move is the result of **4** + (**Size**×2) plus an additional **1** for every **five** Skill Levels (*not* Points) a Breaker has in the *Speed* skill trait.
## Company Traits 
Much like Breakers, the Company they are apart of has traits as well. Companies and Breakers will be explained more in Part 2, but for now its important that you understand the traits that a Company has.
### Primary Attribute Traits 
#### Wealth 
This is a measure of how much money and spending power a Company possesses.
#### Morale 
This is a measure of the general disposition of a Company's populous.
#### Reputation
This is a measure of how the wider world sees a Company.
#### Knowledge
This is a measure of the total sum of a Company's knowledge base.
### Derived Traits 
#### Manpower 
Manpower is a derived trait that codifies the staff of a Company. 

***The* *Math*** 
Manpower is equal to (Wealth times Tier Value) times 4. 
# Part 2: A Company of  Behemoth Breakers
## Before You Begin 
Before you sit down and begin writing things on the paper or typing out things on a PDF, keep a few things in mind.
- Make sure you have a concept in mind. Think of this as "Step 0" of character creation.
- Collaborate with your fellow Breakers to see what all similarities everyone wants to have, such as everyone playing a Lo'darlyr or everyone taking the same School. 
Keep these things in mind, as well as anything your game group finds uncomfortable, as you create your Breaker.
## Creating a Breaker
These are the steps to follow in order to make a Breaker!
### Step 1. 
Select your Breaker's **Species**; this is what culture they belong to. Record your Base Health, Base Mana, and Base Stamina Derived traits, any abilities gained, and your bonuses to your Primary Attribute traits, on your Breaker sheet. Remember, all three Primary Attribute traits start at 2, and you're going to add the adjustments to that base of 2! You'll do this for the next three steps as well.

### Step 2. 
Select your Breaker's **Job**; this is the role they fill within the Company. After you make your selection, record any abilities gained and your Primary Attribute trait bonuses on your Breaker sheet.

>
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Retired Breaker** used to be knee-deep in the action, but took a backseat to new blood, and recently has been forced back into action. 
### Step 3. 
Select your Breaker's **School**; this is the methodology of Behemoth Hunting they are learned in. Make sure you record your Primary Attribute trait adjustments, as well as your School's abilities and actions, on your Breaker sheet. Be keen to mark your Gifted Skill traits, too!

### Step 4. 
Select your Breaker's **Weapon**; this is the tool they use to hunt Behemoths. Make sure you have your Weapon Actions and mechanics handy, and that you record its Primary Attribute trait adjustments, Defenses, and base Weapon Damage die size. 
> [!cards]
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Heavy-Class Weapon: Cleaver-Scythe** allows for swift blows and devastating charged offense.
>
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**Agile-Class Weapon: Bomba Pistols** enables the user to stay evasive and mobile while also maintaining pressure offensively.
> 
> **![[Weapon Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**Balance-Class Weapon: Breaker Fists** offer high speed and high damage at the cost of encouraging one to fly too close to the sun. 
### Step 5. 
Determine your Breaker's **Primary  Attribute Traits**, which are adjusted by the previous four choices. Remember, they begin at 2, and you add the adjustments to that. 
### Step 6. 
Determine your Breaker's **Secondary Attribute Traits**, which are allocated based off their Primary Traits. Each pair of Secondary Attribute traits *cannot* exceed its governing Primary Attribute trait, and it cannot be less than 1. 
### Step 7. 
Spend your 10 starting Skill Points (SP) on **Skill Traits**. Keep in mind that each Skill trait cannot exceed its governing Secondary Attribute trait, unless it is a  Gifted Skill trait, which have their limit *doubled.*
### Step 8. 
Calculate your **Health**, **Stamina**, **Mana**, **Dodge**, **Block** and **Move**. See each of these entries in the Traits section for information how to to calculate them. 
### Step 9. 
Use your starting budget of 2,000 **crowns** to purchase equipment, including starting armor and weaponry. Keep in mind that crafting materials are tracked separately from the  rest of your inventory.
### Step 10.
Finally, describe your Breaker's appearance, fill out their **biography**, and choose their **name** and **pronouns**! Don't forget to mark your Tier on your character sheet too.

### Schools 
All Breakers hunt Behemoths, but almost none of them will do it the exact same way as another. This *could* be due to choice of weaponry, or how many Breakers they prefer in their hunting party, but most commonly, these differences are simply due to the Breakers' *School.*

The Twelve Breaker Schools have twelve different origin stories, as well as twelve different combat methodologies and twelve different life philosophies. The only thing they share, however, is the burden of training some poor commoner to slay a massive, hulking beast from the Uberwald. This burden is an ancient one, and without the Schools fulfilling it, Behemoths surely would rule the world. 

The Breaker's League categorizes the Schools into three *Charters.* These Charters group the schools by the scant similarities in their methods and ideals. When selecting your School, keep in mind that these Charters have no mechanical impact, but *do* have quite the big impact in roleplay! The Charters love a good rivalry, even if they all share a common goal.
#### The Ruby Drums Charter 
The first of the three Charters, the Ruby Drums are united under one idea: *"Might makes right."* Little else unites them; the in-fighting and rivalry amongst these Schools is second to none. 
##### School of the Raging Berserker
> [!statblocks|columns]
>
>> [!blank]  
>> ##### School of the Raging Berserker
>>> Embodying primal rage, thunderous passion and violent fury, Berserkers merciless hunt down Behemoths by straddling the line between lucidity and complete consumption. As the Behemoth wounds the Berserker, their anger grows, and as their anger grows, their strength does as well. It is here, in this space between life and death, that true anger can be found; the anger against the thought of dying.

### Weaponry
>[!info]- Action Tags 1: The Glossary.
> Below is a small glossary of some important action tags, alongside their rules.
>- **Block** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Blocking, and provides how that action changes the Block Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Block -2" is an action that lowers (-) Block Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Block +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Charged** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag can have a number of *additional* actions spent on them in order to gain bonus effects, which are listed in the actions *Charged* section.  
>- **Combo** Actions with this tag are typically done in sequence. After performing a *Combo* action, your *Combo Count* increases by 1. It further increments by 1 for each *Combo* action you take, and resets to 0 when you take an action without this tag.
>- **Combo-Breaker** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cannot be used unless you have a *Combo Count* equal to or higher than the qualifier. 
>- **Dodge** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Dodging, and provides how that action changes the Dodge Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Dodge -2" is an action that lowers (-) Dodge Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Dodge +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Drawing** Actions with this tag allow the user to draw the weapon they plan on using the action with as part of it, forgoing the need to **Draw a Weapon**.
>- **Flourish** Actions with this tag can only be performed once per turn. 
>- **Mana** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost mana to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
>- **Move** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this trait allow the user to move as part of the action, up to a number of spaces given in the qualifier. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Open** An action with this tag can only be used if its the first action of that type you take on your turn. The *type* tags are: Strike, Move, and Defense. 
>- **Piercing** *Strike* actions with this tag ignore half of a Behemoth's applicable Resistances.
>- **Reach** This tag always has a qualifier. *Strike* actions with this tag have their effective targeting area (or reach) increased by the qualifier.
>- **Riposte** This tag always has a qualifier, and always is accompanied by the *Block* tag. Actions with this tag allow a counterattack after successfully blocking an attack. This counterattack can be any *Strike* action that requires a number of actions given in the qualifier (that you could otherwise perform.)
>- **Stamina** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost stamina to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
>- **Strike** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves making an attack, and provides how that action changes the Damage Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Strike -2" is an attack that lowers (-) Damage Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Strike +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered *attacks*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Stunning** *Strike* actions with this tag increase their Weapon Die size by 1 step when dealing damage to a Behemoth's Head (or equivalent.)

*How* a Breaker fights is defined by their School, but *what* they fight *with* is a different story entirely. That question is answered by what Breaker Weapon they use. These weapons are special-engineered to allow the much-smaller mortalkind Breakers to effectively deal with Behemoths. 

Each weapon is specialized to a certain style or method of hunting, which is what allows for the wide diversity of Breaker hunting styles despite there only being 12 Schools. 

These weapons are grouped by their similarities (with these categories being called *Weapon Classes*), which tends to primarily be weight and size. They are grouped this way due to these factors being what restricts a Breaker's Defenses. After all, a rolling Dodge is much easier with a small pair of Bomba Pistols than it is with a giant Cleaver-Scythe.
#### Heavy-Class Weaponry
These are the biggest of the Breaker Weapons, and for what they lack in maneuverability, they make up for in sheer might and/or blocking power. Breakers cannot effectively **Dodge** while equipped with a Heavy-class weapon, but in return, these Breakers can withstand almost any assault.
##### Cleaver-Scythe

>> ##### Cleaver-Scythe
>> ***Heavy-Class***
>> > A massive, cleaving scythe that utilizes a mana-driven momentum sink in order to greatly increase the swinging force of the weapon. This momentum sink can also be purged at will, allowing for the user to change directions mid-swing or even pivot into a blocking stance.

#### Agile-Class Weaponry
>[!info]- Action Tags 2: Qualifiers and You 
>Some tags have *qualifiers.* These are numbers (or die values) that are referenced by a mechanical effect! Here is clarification on how some of the more unique instances of a qualifier work:
> - **"Tag-Name X"** When a tag has a qualifier with a variable in it, the action itself will give you information on how to decide it. Other examples include: **"Tag-Name XdY"**.
> - **"Tag-Name T"** When a tag has the letter "T" as a qualifier, it is referring to a *trait.* The trait in reference will be given in the action, unless it is a *Move* action. "Move T" always refers to your character's **Move** derived trait. This *can* be combined with a variable, though this is rare.

While lacking in size (though not by much,) these Breaker Weapons are much more agile and mobile, allowing for the Breakers that use them to keep up high pressure while deftly avoiding damage. 

Breakers cannot **Block** while equipped with a Agile-Class weapon, but in return, they can avoid nearly any attack!

>>> [!info|no-i txt-l bg-gray]- **Dancing Pace**
>>> Each pair of Bomba Pistols has a number of attacks that, when made in a single turn, cause the weapons' thumperdrums to resonate with mana. Meeting this condition is called being *On Pace,* which can activate certain conditions.
>>---

#### Balance-Class Weaponry
Unlike the other two classes of weaponry, the Balance-Class arsenal allows a Breaker to keep sway by **Dodging**, but also hold the line by **Blocking**. One small caveat, however: they will not be as good at either of them! Balance-Class weapons are *balanced*, after all, not *biased*. 
##### Breaker Fists
> [!statblocks|columns 5]
> 
> 
>> ###### Breaker Fists
>> ***Balance-Class***
>>> A set of large leather and metal gauntlets, which cover up to one's elbow, that sport massive spikes or razor-sharp claws for offense. The gauntlets also boast sizable interlocking plates that can be used for blocking.  Finally, these swift weapons have mana-burner boosters in the hands that can be used to accelerate the user out of the way of attacks or at a Behemoth for incredible damage.

### Equipment 
This section contains all of the personal equipment a Breaker might need for their hunts.
#### Inventory 
A Breaker's inventory has limited space; you have 16 "slots" to carry Breaker equipment with you in the field. Weapons and armor do not count towards this limit, and you can carry a number of any given equipment item equal to the qualifier of its Carry tag.

Crafting materials are tracked separately; they have their own 16-slot inventory. 
#### Arms and Armor
##### Breaker Weapons 
###### Femurstone Weaponry
*Femurstone* is the name given to Behemoth bone that has been treated with alchemical reagents in order to render it pliable while keeping its strength and reducing its brittleness. Weapons made using this material are cheap, and are commonly taken by neophyte Breakers.
>[!statblocks]
>
> # Femurstone Bomba Pistols
> ## *Novice Bomba Pistols*
> ##### *Agile-Class*
> ###### *Weapon*; *120 cr.*  
> ###### *Dancing Pace 5*
> This set of leather-clad Bomba Pistols feature longer grip-sticks to give room to its larger mallet, which gives the drum a powerful, full sound.
> ###### **Perks:**
> - Arcane Restoration 1

>[!statblocks]
>
> #  Femurstone Breaker Fists
> ## *Novice Breaker Fists*
> ##### *Balanced-Class*
> ###### *Weapon*; *120 cr.*  
> These Breaker Fists have a thinner profile than most, lending it to being preferred by users who desire the lightest loadout possible.

>[!statblocks]
>
> # Femurstone Cleaver-Scythe
> ## *Novice Cleaver-Scythe*

> A large weapon that features a Behemoth's jaw bone as the blade, with a thin, wooden haft.
> ###### **Perks:**
> - Arcane Restoration 1
###### Myterran Alloy Weaponry
*Myterran Alloy* is a metal that is created through alloying Myterite, a shallow-depth hard metal, with a blend of stabilizing metals and Behemoth blood. While also commonly used for new Breakers, this material is reserved for more talented Breakers due to being more expensive and slightly unwieldly due to the higher weight.
>[!statblocks]
>
> # Myterran Bomba Pistols
> ## *Novice Bomba Pistols*
> ##### *Agile-Class*
> ###### *Weapon*; *140 cr.*  
> ###### *Dancing Pace 4*
> Featuring short grip-sticks, two long, thin barrels, and small double-beater mallets, these repeater-style Bomba Pistols are preferred by slower, more methodical Breakers.
> ###### **Perks:**
> - Armor Potency 1

>[!statblocks]
>
> # Myterran Breaker Fists
> ## *Novice Breaker Fists*
> ##### *Balanced-Class*
> ###### *Weapon*; *140 cr.*  
> Sharp, violent claws with a wide, embossed surface across the guard-plates, these Breaker Fists are quite a bit heavier than their Femurstone counterpoint, but feature a powerful boost to armor prowess.

## Creating a Company
Creating a company is a collaborative effort; you *can* create one alone, but considering you and your fellow players make up about half the required jobs of a Company, it should be done together. Do each of the following steps together, ensuring that everyone gets to be heard along the way.
### Step 1.
**Name the Company**. Unlike Breakers, declaring a name for the Company is the first step in creating the Company Charter. The name can be really anything the table agrees on, as long as it contains the word "Company" somewhere within it.
### Step 2.
**Create the Banner.** This part, much like step 1, is mostly for roleplay, but the Company is much more roleplay-driven anyway. The Company banner is the logo for its Breakers, and represents them among other Companies in the League. 

Work with your fellow Breakers to draw a small banner for your Company. It doesn't need to be perfect, or even good, as long as it is a symbol to associate with your Company. A written description works as well. 
### Step 3.
**Meet your Patron.** Each Company has a person or circumstance that it is bankrolled by. This is known as the Company Patron. Commonly, this is a rich city-state noble that wants to strike out into the Uberwald to find a new place to stake a new city-state, but other times it might be a powerful merchant, a renowned Breaker of myth, or even the Company itself, coming together with their last crowns to try and make it in the unknown. 

Once your Company selects its Patron, your Fable-Maker will inform you of some additional details about it. Make sure you record these details, as it will include your Patron's primary Goal and their Creed Tenet.  Your Company Patron also affects your Company's Wealth, so ensure that is denoted.
### Step 4.
**Pen the Creed.** Each Company has a *creed*, or an oath that all members take to promise loyalty to the ideals of the Company. In order to create the Company Creed, one of each of the founding members (the players) select a *Tenet* in secret. Once each player has chosen one, reveal them to one another. Now, one by one, each founder must argue their case to the table, which is then voted on (with the Fable-Maker breaking ties). Approved tenets are added to the creed, while ones that are thrown out and the selecting player must select another tenet.

Once each player has contributed a tenet, the Company's Patron adds a tenet, which is predetermined. Then, finally, the Fable-Maker adds a tenet, which can only be vetoed by unanimous vote. 
### Step 5.
**Assign Manpower**
With the charter created, its now time to fill each of the eight Jobs in the Company. Anyone who has a Company-Required Job automatically fills their their Job's slot, and then, the Fable-Maker creates NPCs to fill the roles of any remaining Jobs. Its common for Fable-Makers to involve the Breakers in this process, but depending on the campaign this might change. 

Once each role has been filled, its time to assign *Manpower*. Each Job has a respective team for its Company Building (more on those below), and the members of these teams are represented by *manpower*. Starting manpower must be fully allocated before continuing; each Building cannot exceed its maximum amount of manpower (which is given its in Company Area entry.)

After manpower is allocated, your Company's Morale is 3 (barring any Patron or Creed adjustments.)
### Step 6. 
**Finish Up**
With all of your pieces in place, its time to fill out flavor: founding location, Jobber NPCs and anything else that might've been skipped or looked over. Once all of this is done, you have your Breakers and their Company, meaning its time to commission a license, scout a locale and begin the hunt! 
## The Company 
These are the mechanics for creating a Company.
### Company Name
Every good Company needs a name. Here is a chart you can use to randomly generate a name (or use as inspiration):

| Dice | Format | Adjective | Noun | Verb |
|:----:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|:----:|
|  1   |   -    |           |      |      |
|  2   |  As 1  |           |      |      |
|  3   |   -    |           |      |      |
|  4   |  As 3  |           |      |      |
|  5   |   -    |           |      |      |
|  6   |  As 5  |           |      |      |
|  7   |   -    |           |      |      |
|  8   |  As 7  |           |      |      |
### Company Banner 
Making a Banner is important, but if you don't have the time to brainstorm, talent to draw or willingness for either, use this chart to randomly generate one (or for inspiration.) When looking to outside sources for inspiration, consult historical coats of arms.

| Dice | Shape | Color Scheme | Primary Icon | Secondary Icon |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
|  1   |   -   |              |              |                |
|  2   | As 1  |              |              |                |
|  3   |   -   |              |              |                |
|  4   | As 3  |              |              |                |
|  5   |   -   |              |              |                |
|  6   | As 5  |              |              |                |
|  7   |   -   |              |              |                |
|  8   | As 7  |              |              |                |

### Company Patrons
When selecting a Patron, keep in mind all of the different Breakers; this is a shared aspect of their origin, and should be at least somewhat applicable to all players.
#### Patron: Breaking League 
***Wealth:*** 3
***Tenet:*** Breaker Code of Conduct
Your Company was commissioned directly by the Breaking League itself, typically as a method to educate neophyte Breakers in the field. 
#### Patron: Independent  
***Wealth:*** 1
***Tenet:*** Declaration of Freedom
Instead of an actual Patron, your Company is truly independent; you operate outside of League influence, instead staking it out on your own. This results in low Wealth, yet freedom that only the lack of rules could give.
#### Patron: City-State
***Wealth:*** 4
***Tenet:*** Duty of Care
Your Company is bankrolled by a city-state as a dedicated Behemoth-slaying regiment. These are commonly reserved for large, powerful city-states, though almost all city-states found on the frontier of the Harrowlands also employ them.
#### Patron: Wealthy Aristocrat
***Wealth:*** 4
***Tenet:*** Pact of Particular Obligations
Your Company's Patron is a wealthy noble, royal or some other aristocrat that allegedly wants a piece of the growing Behemoth part trade. They have particular requests, odd mannerisms and definitely an ulterior motive.
#### Patron: Breakers-For-Hire
***Wealth:*** 4
***Tenet:*** Sellwords' Decree
Your Company is a mercenary company; you make your crowns by traveling from city-state to city-state, offering your services to them. While you are largely independent, you are still bound to Breaking League regulations, as well as the Mercantile League.
#### Patron: Anonymous Benefactor
***Wealth:*** 6
***Tenet:*** Vow of Perfect Anonymity
Your Company is totally unaware of its benefactor, and as such, does not maintain contact with them. Instead, your benefactor randomly contacts you with odd, sometimes dire, requests.
### Company Creed 
The Company Creed is made up of a series of *tenets*, one for each player, plus one for the Fable-Maker and one for the Company Patron. These codes are restrictions and edicts that all members of the Company need to follow; they directly affect Company traits, with most being a tradeoff. Some Tenets also allow access to Auxiliary Areas, which are special Company buildings.
#### Breaker Tenets
These are the tenets that Breakers can choose from when drafting the Company Creed. They are divided into *sets*; a set of Tenets are alike in theme, and sometimes have unique effects when paired together. 

Set effects often change how core Company buildings and projects work, so be sure to discuss them thoroughly. If your Company meets the requirement of a set, you *have* that set effect; they are not optional.
##### Pactbound Tenets
*Set Requirements:* 3 Pact tenets; Duty to the Temple tenet.
*Set Effect:* When Knowledge increases, Reputation also increases by 1. The opposite is also true.
**Blood Augury Pact**
Augments the Research Center.
**Faustian Pact**
Augments the Alchemitory.
**Hephaestian Pact**

**Duty to the Temple**
Auxiliary Area: Consecrated Temple, or the Desecrated Temple if your creed also has three Pact tenets.
**Oath of the World Table**
Auxiliary Area: World Table, or the Round Table if your creed has 1 Oath, 1 Code, and 1 Duty tenets.
##### Thiefbound Tenets

**Treasure Hoarders' Decree**
Project Wealth costs are decreased.
**Mercantile Decree**

#### Patron Tenets
**Breaker Code of Conduct**
All School-taught Breakers are educated on the Breaker Code, but few rarely follow it without League enforcement. As an official Breaking League Company, however, you follow the Three Cardinals of Conduct to the tee. These are not the *only* rules in the Code of Conduct, but reproducing that would require a whole other book.
1. Put your Fellow Breaker above All 
2. Hunt from necessity, not desire.
3. Nature before mortals, mortals before Behemoth.
**Declaration of Freedom**
Your Company abides by your own rules. Work together to pen three cardinal rules for your Company. 
Due to the fact you have no Patron past yourself and your fellow Breakers, you cannot Contact Your Patron during downtime.Your Company also gains +1 to starting Knowledge, Reputation and Morale.
**Duty of Care**
Your Company must "put the wellbeing of the City-State above all else." You also cannot travel outside of your City-State's territory without express permission.
Additionally, your Company begins with a +2 to Reputation, but a -2 to Knowledge, to represent your greater influence with your city-state and lack of information due to being on the fringe of civilization. 
**Pact of Particular Obligations**
Your Company's Patron sets forth an odd stipulation of a sort, which will be given to you by the Fable-Maker. 
Additionally, your Company begins with a +2 to Knowledge, but a -2 to Reputation, to represent your Patron's esoteric knowledge and social stigma. 
**Sellswords' Decree**
Your Company follows the Sellswords' Decree: 
1. Never work for free.
2. Always split profits with equity.
3. Seek crowns before favors.
If your Company's Wealth is below 4, it automatically becomes demoralized.

# Part 3: Playing The Game 
## Matters of Life and Death 
As already explained, Breakers have an amount of tHP thats divided between sHP and mHP. As long as these values remain at their maximum, nothing is wrong. However, when those values changes, issues arise. 
### Healing 
As long as tHP is above 0, Breakers can do *something* to prevent it from going down lower. Typically, this is in the form of defending, but sometimes, a Breaker needs to restore Health. This is *healing*. Healing is always assigned one of the three Health types, with tHP healing being the most rare and sHP being the most common. 
### Fainting
When tHP hits 0, however, big problems arise. Most of the time, the Breaker simply *faints*, gaining the **Unconscious** condition. As long as a Breaker is at 0 tHP, they cannot lose the **Unconscious** condition, and they are at risk of entering a death spiral. If a Breaker is **Unconscious** and takes damage that does not exceed their tHP, they must make an *average* *Fortitude*, *Resolve*, or *Tenacity* test (the Breaker's choice). On a success, they remain stable and **Unconscious**. On a failure, they enter a death spiral.
### Death Spiral
Breaker culture long tells of a Breaker seeing their life flash before their eyes when they begin to die in combat. This is called a *death spiral*. When a Breaker "enters a death spiral" they begin at #1 on the track below. If a Breaker would undergo an effect that would make them enter a death spiral while they are currently in one, they instead advance the track by 1 step. Any healing administered to a Breaker in a death spiral instead heals 1 mHP and they lose the **Unconscious** condition (this is referred to as "exiting a death spiral.)

Each step of the death spiral occurs at the beginning of the Breaker's turn, and after performing the relevant action to the step, their turn ends.
1. Your worst fear flashes before your eyes. Tell your fellow Breakers about this fear, then make an *average* *Fortitude*, *Resolve*, or *Tenacity* test, your choice. On a critical success, you heal 1 mHP and exit the death spiral. On a success, you remain at this step. On a failure or critical failure, you advance 1 step. 
2. Visions of your favorite bond appear to you. Tell your fellow Breakers about who it is. If they are currently in the engagement, their next attack is a critical hit or their next test is a critical success. Then, make an *average* *Fortitude*, *Resolve*, or *Tenacity* test, but it cannot be the Skill you tested for #1. On a success of any kind, you remain at this step. On a failure of any kind, you advance 1 step. 
3. As your final moments approach, you think of home. Tell your fellow Breakers about home, and if you miss it. Then, make an *average* *Fortitude*, *Resolve*, or *Tenacity* test, but it cannot be the Skill you tested for #1 or #2. On a critical success, you remain at this step. On any other result, you advance 1 step. 
4. Tell your fellow Breakers about your favorite memory, then make a choice: Final Fight or Peaceful Rest. If you choose a Final Fight, you can immediately stand up and take your full turn. During this turn, you deal an additional die of damage, make all tests with favor and you cannot take damage. If you slay the target Behemoth during this turn, you exit the death spiral. If you choose Peaceful Rest, you say your goodbyes to your fellow Breakers, passing on to the next life. For the rest of the engagement, your fellow Breakers deal an extra die of damage and make all tests with favor. 

Exiting a death spiral at step 2+ leaves a Breaker with a permanent injury. Such injuries will be available in a future playlist.
## Actions 
Typically, you are unrestricted in how many "things" you can do, at least by game mechanics. This changes when you enter an engagement, as in order to make sense of combat against a Behemoth, things become much more granular and you need to track your actions carefully.

At the start of each turn you take in an engagement, you gain 6 action points (AP) and 2 reaction points. (RP) These can be spent on *actions*, which there are four types of: single actions, activities, reactions, and free actions.

**Single Actions** specifically cost only 1 AP, and are swift to perform. 1 AP (and in turn, single actions) represent 2 seconds of a 12-second round, for reference.

**Activities** are actions that require 2 or more AP to perform. Commonly, they are a sequence of single actions taken in rapid succession, such as the Musketeer's **Gunnery Slide** being a **Basic Attack**, **Move**, and **Dodge** all performed in sequence.

**Reactions** have triggers that must be met in order to use the action. You can use a reaction *any* time its conditions are met, even on your own turn and in the middle of another action. Reactions are commonly triggered by external forces, like allies and Behemoths.

**Free Actions** do not cost any AP to use, nor RP, but instead have very specific triggers or are weaker compared to other actions. Free actions with no trigger can only be used on your turn, unless it allows otherwise.

In order to perform an action, you declare what action you want to use, then check to see if you meet its requirements (such as the trigger on a free action or reaction.) If you do, you spend the requisite AP or RP, then the action is performed. 
### General Actions

## Movement  and Cover
This game assumes that, at least during engagements, your table is using a grid, either physical or digital, to mark positions of Behemoth and Breaker. The following rules are written with that in mind, and if your table does not choose to do so, these rules might need adjustment.

Moving across the ground is not the only way; some Breakers might be able to fly, climb sheer verticals, or even burrow underfoot. These are all different types of the **Move** derived trait. 

Some abilities, like the Shadow's **Second Story Work**, grant you new types of **Move**, which can be adjusted by abilities independently from your Ground **Move**, although they are all calculated in the same manner.

When changing **Move** types, you have to perform another **Move** action with the new type, but you do not need to finish the previous **Move** action to do so. For example, if you've moved 5 spaces to the base of a tree, you could then **Move** with your Climb 6 spaces up the tree. 

Whenever you use a **Move** action, you move up to the allowed amount (typically your Move trait) using any type you have available. As long as the movement is not part of an activity, it does not have to be all at once; think of it like a "pool" of movement. For instance, you could take the **Move** action, go forward 3 spaces, make an an attack, then move back 3 spaces to where you began.

You can move through any space of willing characters or any character that is 2 or more Sizes larger than you (this includes most Behemoths.) You cannot, however, end your turn in such a space, but you *can* end movement there as long as you leave before the end of your turn. If you end movement in another character's space and cannot leave, you fall prone into an adjacent square at the end of your turn.

You can also share spaces with prone characters, given that they are either willing or incapacitated (such as through **Unconsciousness** or by being dead.)
### Diagonal Movement
 Moving diagonally covers more ground, therefore we need to count that movement differently. The first space of diagonal movement you make a turn counts as 1 space, but the second counts as 2. This count alternates thereafter, between the two. For example, moving across 4 spaces diagonally, you'd count 1 space, then 2, then 1, then 2, for a total of 6 spaces. This track spans your entire turn, but "resets" at the end of your turns. 
### Falling 
If you fall more than 4 spaces, when you land, you take 5 crushing damage for every 2 spaces you fell (if odd, round *up*.) Falling into water, snow, or any other soft surface allows you to treat the fall as if it was shorter, up to the depth of the material. For example, falling 4 spaces into 2-space deep snow means you, effectively, only fell 2 spaces, thus only taking 5 crushing damage. If you take any damage from a fall, you land prone. Finally, you fall at a rate of about 200 spaces a round, if you are in free fall.

If you land on a character at the end of your fall, they take the same amount of damage you did, and you both become prone (unless they are bigger than you by 2 or more Sizes.)
### Terrain
When in the field, there are certain features of the landscape that can make traversal more difficult, but when leveraged correctly, can also be used to to gain advantage over your marks. 

#### Difficult Terrain 
Difficult terrain is terrain that significantly impedes your ability to move through it effectively. This can vary from mucky swamp mud to dense grasping moss, but regardless of description, it all functions the same. Moving into a square of **difficult terrain** costs an extra space of movement, and **harsh difficult terrain** costs 2 extra spaces (or 3 spaces to move 1 space.) Additionally, while in any form of **difficult terrain**, lower your **Dodge** die size by 1 step. 

Any ability that lets you ignore **difficult terrain** allows you to ignore ALL forms of it. 
#### Perilous Terrain
Some terrain, such as narrow surfaces and uneven ground, are difficult to traverse normally and run the risk of compromising balance or impeding movement. This is known as **perilous terrain**, and such a feature always has an associated test with it. For example, a steep incline might require an *average* ***Physicality*** test to traverse. You are defenseless while traversing **perilous terrain**.
### Cover 
When you are behind terrain and other obstacles that block Behemoth claws, prevent jaws from snapping, and guard against breath weapons, you're behind cover. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus to both **Resistances**, and you roll an additional die when you use an active defense. You can also attempt to **Hide** while behind cover, and when you do so, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the test you make (typically a *Dexterity* test,)

Cover *is* relative; you can have cover against a Behemoth, but *not* against a construct it might make.

You can also take cover behind larger characters than you. If a character is at least 2 sizes larger than you, that character blocks enough of your space to provide cover. This cover *can* be used to **Hide**, but not from the character providing the cover. 
## Effects and Area 
Anything that has an impact on the game world is called an effect. Simple. Effects sometimes require tests, and they always have a *duration*, an *area* and a *target*. Sometimes, they'll also have a *range* or *reach*.
### Duration 
Most effects happen "instantly," or right as they are used. Attacking, moving, defending and interacting are all "instant" effects that do not take additional time outside their actions to resolve. Other effects last for a certain time, or duration, however. Once this duration has elapsed, the effect ends. 

Effects will either last a duration of time or a duration of rounds; these are technically one in the same, as a round is 12 seconds, but if an effect is given in rounds, it typically will have little out-of-engagement use. 

Any effect that does last for a duration of rounds will decrease its remaining duration at the *beginning* of the turn it began on. Some effects, mostly detrimental ones, however last "through" a number of turns, or "until the end" of a turn. These instead decrease remaining duration at the end of the turn, rather than the beginning. 

Durations given in times will always last longer than the average engagement, which is around 2 minutes (or 10 rounds.) These effects simply end when that time has passed. 
### Range and Reach 
Effects always have a specified range, or reach, that they can work within. Range is used to refer to ranged effects, while reach is used in reference to melee, or touch, effects. 

Ranged weaponry always has a given **Range** trait. Attacks with such weapons are only effective as long as the user is within that distance from the target. Attacking outside of this range lowers the die step of all attacks with that weapon by 1 step, and a further 1 step for each additional multiple of that range. Attacks at a range that would bring damage die size below a d2 are not possible. For example, if you are using Bomba Pistols, which have a range of 6 spaces, you take no die size penalty as long as you are up to 6 spaces from the target. If you are 7 to 12 spaces away, you take a -1 die size penalty, a -2 penalty for being 13 to 18 spaces away and finally a -3 penalty (for a d2, the limit)  for being 19 to 24 spaces away.

Reach, meanwhile, is how far away you can physically touch with your body or weapon. Melee *Strike* actions rely on reach, and your base reach is equal to your Size, in spaces. This means larger characters can reach farther away, but some actions can also increase reach. 
### Targets 
All effects target something, lest it be a character or a space. You cannot target something you cannot see; this is called *line-of-sight*. You also cannot target something that does not meet the requirements of an action's stipulations. 

Some effects require willing targets. Only you may choose if your Breaker is willing, and only the Fable-Maker can decide if an NPC is willing. You can still make this choice even if your Breaker is **Unconscious**. 

If an effect refers to an ally, it means someone that is "on your side;" this could mean another PC, but it can also mean an NPC that is friendly towards you or even an innocent bystander. You do not count as your own ally; if an effect can target you as you generate it, it will specify. 
### Area 
Effects occupy a distinct shape and size that is called its area. An area always has an *origin* point which it extends out from, and from that origin point, the area's size is counted in the same manner as movement. There are four separate types of areas: emanation, bursts, cones, and lines.
#### Burst 
Burst effects mark their genesis point at a single corner of a square within range, and spread in all directions, out to that effect's specified radius. For example, the Invoker's **Invoke Elementia** generates a 3-space burst, meaning the area it generates extends out 3 spaces in every direction from the corner of the space you chose. It would affect all creatures whose space (or even just a single square of it) is within the burst.
#### Cone 
Cone effects extend out from you in a "quarter circle." When aiming a cone, the first square of it must either share an edge with your space (if the cone is orthogonal) or touch a corner (if diagonal.) Cones cannot be aimed in a manner so that they overlap your space.

The cone, once aimed, extends out for a number of spaces, widening as it goes. 
#### Emanation
An emanation effect *emanates* from each side of your space, extending out the specified number of spaces in all directions. Due to the fact that the *sides* are the starting point, larger Sized characters have bigger areas for their emanations. More starting points means more area, simple. 

Unless stated, the creature at the center of the emanation can choose to be affected by it. 
#### Line
Line effects simply shoot forth from the center of your space, in a direction of choice, affecting all that it intersects with. Unless stated, lines are always only 1 space wide.
## Modes of Play 
### Engagement
An engagement is a series of rounds in which Breakers, Behemoths and occasionally other participants act in sequence. Participants are ranked in order of initiative to determine the sequence they act in, and then they take their turns in this order until the engagement ends. The rules in this section assume a hunting engagement, or a battle with a Behemoth, but the structure can be applied to any engagement. 
##### Step 1: Rank Initiative
When your Fable-Maker calls for it, you'll roll initiative to determine your place within the engagement order, otherwise called the initiative order. This order is the sequence in which participants act in. The engagement begins when you roll initiative. 

There are three *Skill* traits you can test to determine your initiative, which are *Speed, Observation* and *Creativity*. Typically, your Fable-Maker will inform you as to which Skill trait you need to test. 

Your Fable-Maker makes tests for initiative for anyone other than the Breakers, which is most commonly just the target Behemoth. In an engagement with a Behemoth, the target Behemoth (and only the target) will have two turns within the initiative order. More on this later.

Once all of the initiative totals are found, they are ranked from highest to lowest. This is one of the few times a higher result on a test is better than a lower one!

If two Breakers would be tied, they can choose who goes first. If a Breaker would tie with a Behemoth, the Behemoth goes first.
##### Step 2: The Round 
A round begins with the first participant in the initiative order begins their turn and it ends when the one with the lowest initiative ends their turn. An in-depth process of a turn is detailed below. Characters can oftentimes act outside of their turn, as well, with reactions and free actions.

At the start of the *first* round 
##### Step 3: Begin the Next Round 
Once everyone in the encounter has taken a turn, the round is over and the next one begins. Initiative is not re-rolled (except in very special circumstances); the new round proceeds in the same order, over and over until the engagement is over. 
##### Step 4: End the Encounter 
When the Behemoth runs, is slain or some other resolution is reached, the engagement ends. You then exit engagement mode; typically, the game goes into exploration mode. At the end of a hunt, the Fable-Maker will award Skill Points, Trait Points, or even a Tier increase, if the requirements are met!
#### Turns
When its your turn to act, you can use any amount of actions as long as you have the AP to do so. 

When you've spent all of your AP, your turn ends and the next character in the initiative order begins their turn. 

In order to better understand a turn, it is divided into three steps, or phases.
##### Phase 1: Start
There are many things that might happen at the start of your turn, as it is common point of time tracking for the passage of time. This phase consists of the following steps, which can be performed in any order.
1. Reduce the remaining duration of any effects you created that last for a duration of rounds. 
2. Use up to 1 free action or reaction with a trigger of "Your turn begins" or similar. 
3. If you're in a death spiral, perform the actions asked of you in your current step.

Regardless of the order you took the aforementioned steps, the following is always the final step you take during this phase.
4. Regain your 6 AP and 2 RP. If you have any remaining RP from your last turn, you lose them. They do not "roll over." Some abilities and conditions can alter how many AP and RP you get.
##### Phase 2: Act 
You can use actions in any order you wish, as long as you have the AP or RP to cover them. You must complete one action fully before beginning another, however. 

Once you've spent all of your AP, your turn ends. You can choose to terminate your turn early, which causes you to lose your remaining AP (but not RP.)
##### Phase 3: End 
Now that you've acted, you reach the end of your turn. Take the following steps in any order.
1. End any effects that last until the end of your turn.
2. Take any persistent damage you might have, such as from a condition or ability. Then, make any tests you need to in order to attempt to end those effects.
3. Use up to 1 free action with the trigger of "Your turn ends."
4. Resolve anything else that happens at the end of your turn. 
#### Activities in Engagements
Any activity that takes longer than 1 turn to perform cannot typically be used during an engagement. When you commit to an activity during your turn, you commit to all the required actions; if an action is interrupted, you lose any AP spent on it.
#### Reactions in Engagements
Reactions allow you to respond immediately to what is currently happening. Typically, 
### Exploration
Exploration mainly focuses on movement throughout an environment and roleplay, unlike engagements. Most commonly, Breakers will be in Exploration mode when tracking a Behemoth through a hunting locale, but other times they might be exploring include traveling from one region to another with their Company, scouting out new hunting locales or venturing to a city-state or settlement to meet with other Companies or League officials. Rather than measuring movement in spaces, it is measured in *miles-per-hour*. This is *not* diegetic, but it is much easier to present the information in this manner than it is to teach you a new system of measurement. 

In exploration mode, while things are less granular than in an engagement, things are still compartmentalized somewhat to allow for easier understanding, both on the player and Fable-Maker. While in exploration mode, each member of the hunting party fills a specified role. These roles are not "set in stone;" multiple different hunting party members can swap between them during any given exploration scene, or even in the midst of one. In essence, exploration roles are there to help the Fable-Maker get an idea of what each Breaker is doing generally, with each role's Exploration activities informing the table what each Breaker is doing specifically.

After a long day of exploration engagements on the hunt, it might be necessary to rest and make Camp.  
#### Travel Speed 
The rate at which you can travel is relative to your Move trait. The rates are given in the chart below. 

| Move  | Spaces-per-Minute | Miles-per-hour | Miles-per-Day |

Movement rates are the "pace" at which an exploration scene moves; if a scene is in spaces-per-minute, then each moment, or beat, is about a minute long. The same is true for miles-per-hour and miles-per-day.

These rates assume that the traveler is moving over flat, even and clear terrain, at a brisk pace that is not exhausting. Moving over difficult terrain cuts these rates in half and harsh difficult terrain reduces it to one-third of the listed amount. If travel is through perilous terrain, that terrain's test must be made once every increment (hour or day.) 
#### Exploration Roles 
At the start of any given exploration scene, commonly after the Fable-Maker asks "Who's doing what?" each Breaker will need to fill a role. These roles within a hunting party are apart of League Breaker training; all Breakers simply know how to do them as a part of their skill set for Breaking. Different Breakers might be better at one role than another however, but don't let this shoehorn you into always doing that role! If you want to try scouting instead of gathering for once, just ask your hunting party.

Each of the four roles listed must be filled, but one Breaker can do up to two at once (in case of an incapacitated Breaker.) This is the diegetic reason for there to be at least four Breakers per hunting party, as the League deems these roles mandatory when in the field for proper safety. Once each role has been claimed, any additional Breaker is free to double-up on one or more of the roles, or do something else entirely. It is considered good etiquette to always take a role, however. 
##### Archivist
The archivist keeps track of the hunting party's movements through a hunting locale or across a journey. Unlike a Company Researcher, an archivist keeps much more rudimentary records, commonly for the purpose of adapting to an ever-changing environment. 
###### Archive the Area
*Exploration*
You record the locale, making a map of the area. You travel at half your regular pace. When you enter into a new area in a hunting locale, the Fable-Maker will give you a specific overview of the ore, flora and fauna in that area. Then, make an *average Observation* test. 
***Success:*** You make detailed notes of the area, which are good enough to contribute towards making a map. See the Chart A Map downtime activity for more details.
***Failure:*** Your notes for the area are poor, and cannot be useful when making a map.

###### Behemoth Observation Order
*Exploration, Plan*
You instruct your hunting party on what information to pay attention to when next fighting your target Behemoth. At the end of the next encounter in this area, make a *hard Memory* test. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus for each member of your hunting party that succeeds an *easy Observation* test. 
***Critical Success:*** You draft excellent notes, which grants a bonus towards Research on that Behemoth.
***Success:*** You draft great notes on the target, which can contribute towards Research on that Behemoth. 
***Failure:*** You draft poor notes on the Behemoth, which are not good enough to contribute towards Behemoth Research.
##### Leader 
The leader ensures that everyone is "formed up" in order to make traversal across the terrain easier. Leaders also propose plans for the next engagement, coordinating Breakers to ensure a proper plan is followed.
***Exploration Activities***
###### Declare Marching Order
*Exploration*
When traveling long distances, leaders can call for marches. When a leader Declares a Marching Order, up to 20 people (not including the leader) gain the benefit of the Hustle exploration activity. 
###### Form a Plan
*Exploration, Plan*
While exploring, you encourage others to perform various components of a larger plan. Your hunting party gains a +2 circumstance bonus to any test they make as part of a *Plan* action.
At the beginning of the next engagement, the target Behemoth is surprised X, where X is 1 for every 2 *Plan* actions affecting the area. 
###### Improvise
*Exploration, Plan*
Instead of a well-thought-out plan, you choose to wing it when the fighting starts. Make a *hard Resolve* test. You can only take this activity if there are no other *Plan* actions being taken in a given area. 
***Critical Success:*** At the beginning of the next engagement, the target Behemoth is surprised 2.
***Critical Failure:*** At the beginning of the next engagement, roll a d6. Your hunting party has the corresponding condition for the first round:
- 1-2: Offenseless 
- 3-4: Defenseless 
- 5-6: Immobile
##### Scout 
The scout ventures out ahead or behind their hunting party. This could be to watch for prowling Behemoths, or to lay an ambush for a routed Behemoth, or even to find the best angle of attack on its lair.  The League recommends characters with high Move traits to be a scout, since it requires being out and away from the hunting party.
***Exploration Activities***
###### Scouting
*Exploration*
You travel at twice your normal rate. At the beginning of the next engagement, your hunting party gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative, unless the target Behemoth has the **Erratic** ability. **Special** You can use this action alongside another Scout exploration activities.
###### Lay A Trap
*Exploration, Plan*
**Requirement** You have a Trap item in your inventory;  You spend 10 minutes setting up and hiding a trap for an ambush. Select an item that meets the requirement, then explain how you hide it in the environment and a condition for it to trigger. Then, make an *average* *Creativity* test.
***Success:*** During the next engagement in that area, the trap is undetectable by Behemoths and automatically springs when the condition is met.
***Failure:*** During the next engagement in that area, the trap automatically springs when the condition is met.
***Critical Failure:*** During the next engagement in that area, the trap springs under a random condition, which is determined by the Fable-Maker.

###### Set an Ambush 
*Exploration, Plan*
You spend 10 minutes locating and marking hiding places for your hunting party. Make a *hard Observation* test. 
***Critical Success:*** Everyone in your hunting party begins the next engagement hidden from the target Behemoth.
***Success:*** You begin the next engagement hidden, and other members can Hide as a free action with a trigger of "You roll initiative."
***Failure:*** You and other members can Hide as a free action with a trigger of "You roll initiative."
***Critical Failure:*** Your hunting party begins the engagement surprised 1. 

##### Tracker 
The tracker's main job is to find the Behemoth and keep track of their movements across various areas of a hunting locale.

While in the thick of exploration, inform your Fable-Maker what you'd like to do along the way. If your goal is to travel and just do nothing further, you move at the full travel speed given in the table. If you instead want to do something, explain generally what you want to do. Your Fable-Maker will then select the best matching exploration activity that matches your description. Some of these activities limit how fast you can go while traveling. 

These are the most common exploration activities.
