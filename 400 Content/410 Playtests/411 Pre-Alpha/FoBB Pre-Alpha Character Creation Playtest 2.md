# Introduction
>[!quote|author] Garrison Commander Alessia
>WARNING, ALL BREAKERS: ***Behemoth Emergence Imminent.***
Welcome to the second pre-alpha playtest for *Fable of the Behemoth Breakers*, a Monster-Hunting Tabletop Roleplaying Game. In this world, you are a _Breaker_, a warrior trained in powerful magic and massive weaponry to engage in combat with Behemoths, creatures that routinely emerge from the Uberwald to attempt to destroy mortal settlements.

Breakers are organized into Companies, and it is these Companies that strike out into the Uberwald to claim territory and begin new settlements. Much like last time, you won't be making your Company this playtest, but that *is* the planned focus of Playtest 3!
## Goals 
The goals of *this* playtest are as follows:
- Test the full Character Creation; I need to know if it works, how well it works, and how fun it is.
- Test the mechanics of trait tests. These test rolls are to help see any early design problems in the system and correct them.
- Address early mathematics issues. Right now, as the game is in its infancy, these foundational mechanics need to be tuned well.
## Game Materials
In order to play this playtest, you'll need a few things, which are listed here:
- Either (or both):
	- A set of dice, d2 through d20, with 2 additional d6 (for a total of 3d6) 
	- A digital dice roller. While less fun, digital dice make playing the game much easier.
- Basic reading comprehension. 
- [The Official Behemoth Breaker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n2CYNY7mnI1LOLS1rMADno1L36xFq9Jyu9224PD4lhM/edit?usp=sharing) character sheet. It does most of the math for you, just to save us all some time.
- [Your Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/JCkiN5bPQHvCxcnh6)
- Some scratch paper or a notepad document to take notes as you do the playtest.
- About 30-45 minutes of free time.
# Instructions
After you have your materials in order, you're ready to begin. Below are the instructions as for what you need to do for this playtest.
1. Fill out Section 1 of the Feedback Form.
2. Complete Character Creation, under Section 1. It's got a step-by-step guide, so don't worry. This'll take the longest, by far. Make sure you read each part before moving onto the next; the content is presented in the order you'll need to learn it!
3. Complete Section 2 of the Feedback Form.
4. Complete the test rolls set forth in ***Testing the Test***. Make sure you are recording your results and the answers to the questions each test asks!
5. Fill out Sections 3 and 4 of the Feedback Form.

# Part 1: Rules Of Play

>With food, friends, and a story, there is nothing one could ever deem "impossible."

Now that you've seen who and what you'll need, read forth, for the rules to forge your Breaker and their Company await.
## The Common Vernacular
Before you start reading rules, we need to all be on the same page about the language being used here. While most readers are likely well-acquitted with the vernacular of "roll to hit", "nat 20" and "NPC", maybe you, dear Breaker, are not. If so, this section is for you. We'll go over some common terms that you'll need to know now.

"Roll" means to literally (or virtually) roll a die, singular, (or dice, plural) across the table, down the tower (search "dice tower" on the internet, then curse me for a new obsession) or onto the pad. 

A "natural" result of a die means JUST the roll. A natural or "nat" 20 on a d20 is the die itself showing a 20, without any rules alterations. 

"Character", specifically in the terms of "Player Character" and "Non-Player Character", refers to entities within the game-space. Anytime this game refers to "characters", it encompasses anything with a testable statistic. "Player Characters" are who you, the players, play as, and "Non-Player Characters" are literally everything else. Simple!

Finally, "spaces". This game's world (or *setting*) doesn't have modern measurement units, but learning a whole new system is a big ask, so the game does some one way math for you. One "space", which is 1 square on a grid, is equal to 5 feet. Keep this in mind if you ever want to do the math to figure out how many miles-per-hour that uber-fast Breaker Fist build can throw itself at the nearest soon-to-be-inconvenienced Behemoth. 

These are the very basics of the "rulespeech" this game uses. Your vocabulary will be expanded as you read more, but like any new language, you must be willing to speak it! This metaphor is close to breaking down, so lets move on.
## The Math Stands Alone
"Basic arithmetic" was listed as a material you'd need to play this game, so lets explain what we mean by that. 

The four basic operations of math &mdash; multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction &mdash; are used throughout this game's rules. This is done because of one of the central design tenets of this game: it will never be simple for the sake of simplicity. The math required is not complex, but to boil the game down past it would compromise on the intent of the game. That being said, there are some rules to follow.
- Always round down. This is not how standard math works. I apologize. I have not the mathematics skills to balance the game in such a manner where this is not required.
- Follow the order of operations.
- Specific beats general. If a trait tells you to add, but a Perk tells you to multiply, then you multiply!
## The Dice 
Dice are a core part of any dice-driven TTRPG, and *Behemoth Breakers* is no different! For this game, you'll need a full range of dice (d2 through d20), *as well* as some method of virtual dice-rolling. This recommendation is given under the assumption that you do not have access to more obscure dice sizes; if you do, roll them! 

The way that this game most commonly interacts with dice is in the form of *changing sizes.* When an affect refers to increasing or decreasing a die size, it is in reference to the following track. In order to find the adjustment, begin with the *base* die size, then go right the number of indicated steps to find the increased size, or go left to find the decreased size. 

**d2-d4-d6-d8-d10-d12-d14-d16-d18-d20**

The most common die used for this game is the **d6**, as any check (referred to as *tests*) uses a pool of **3d6**. In case you are unfamiliar, that "3" refers to the amount of die you need; three individual six-sided dice.

This vernacular is important to understanding the game's referential shorthand; take time to make sure you understand it. For a working example, how many dice does one need to roll 2d12+3d4? 
## The Art of the Test
When something is left to chance, dice need to be involved; if you find yourself asking "can my Breaker jump that gap?" then you need to roll for it!

These rolls are called *tests*, and they are done with 3d6. 
For the question above, your Fable-Maker would tell you: "Lets see if you can. Make an *easy* *Dexterity* test." 

Then, you'd take your dice, roll them, and compare them to the *target number* (TN.) In order to calculate the TN, you'll need to understand two things: *difficulty* and *modifiers*.
### Difficulty Levels
In our example, your Fable-Maker declared that it was an "*easy*" test. What does this mean, exactly?

In *Behemoth Breakers*, the difficulty of a test is what determines the base number that one needs to roll under in order to succeed the test. Below is a chart explains the base TN for each difficulty level.

| Difficulty Level | Target Number |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|
|     Trivial      |         16         |
|    Very Easy     |         14         |
|       Easy       |         12         |
|     Average      |         10         |
|       Hard       |         8          |
|    Very Hard     |         6          |
|     Extreme      |         4          |

To answer the current question: an *easy* Dexterity test has a TN of 12, *before modifiers.* Now, all you need to know is what a modifier is.
### Modifiers: The Good, The Bad, and The Stacking
At their most basic, attribute and skill traits are just modifiers. They are modifiers that are added to a target number when making a test. This allows two different characters to have different chances of success and failure, or strengths and weaknesses! 

There are other kinds of modifiers, though, and they all have *types*. *Trait* is a kind of modifier, alongside *circumstance*, *item*, and *status.*

Trait modifiers (which will always be positive) are due to a specific trait being applied to that test. 

Circumstance modifiers are incurred due to environment and conditions.

Item modifiers are due to one's equipment.

Status modifiers are incurred via abilities and magical effects. 

Positive modifiers are known as *bonuses*, while negative modifiers are called *penalties.* Any two bonuses or penalties of the *same* type do not stack, unless specifically mentioned; in the case of multiple, non-stacking modifiers of the same type, you always use the highest bonuses and lowest penalties. Modifiers of different types *always* stack together.

To put it all together in the game's shorthand, a "-1 *item penalty* to **Agility**" is a -1 item-type modifier to any **Agility** test (this includes Skill traits under **Agility**; modifiers "trickle down" so to speak.)

Lets apply this to our running example. Say for example your Breaker has *Dexterity* 4, and you've got a -1 *item penalty* to **Agility**.  Since you're making an *easy* *Dexterity* test, your base TN is 12. Then, you add your *Dexterity*, which is 4, giving you 16. Then, subtract the -1 penalty, for a final TN of 15. Roll 3d6, and add the results. You get a 14...success! You manage to clear the gap, jumping to the other side.

After the first few tests, it won't be this time consuming; you'll commit things to memory, find shortcuts, and get it all down-pat in no time at all.
### Critical Success and Failure
Sometimes, you succeed in a radical manner; you perfectly ace the landing as you leap from one side to the other. This occurs when your 3d6 roll totals 3 or 4. This is called a critical success.

The opposite of this can also occur when your roll totals 17 or 18. This, in turn, is called a critical failure, and it happens regardless of the target number; there is always a chance of circumstantial failure. Remember, the dice are not the measure of your ability, the TN is! 

What happens as a result of a critical outcome depends on the situation and is commonly left up to Fable-Maker interpretation. 
### Mortal Combat !
This next section will explain the fundamentals of making the two forms of combat rolls that are essential to this game. Unlike most games, accuracy is not in question when up against a Behemoth; Breakers simply attack. The variance, the drama, comes in how the defender reacts! 
#### On the Attack !
As mentioned, attacking works a little differently in *Behemoth Breakers* than it does in most other games; a test of accuracy is not performed when making an attack. Breakers are skilled, trained hunters of massive creatures; *if* they can hit it is not in question, but rather whether or not their mark can avoid or sustain the damage *is*. 

In order to make an attack, you'll need to understand your Damage Die for that action. This will be explained later, but the long-of-the-short is this medium(ish)-length drabble: every weapon has a Damage Die that is altered in size by the *Strike* action (or attack) being performed. 

Once you know the Damage Die size, as well as how many you're rolling, you have successfully found the Damage Dice Pool for this attack. You then roll these dice, and add the values together. This is the *Damage Dealt* by that attack. 

Keep in mind: this works the exact same way for Behemoths. 

Lets do an example. For this attack, the Behemoth you're fighting targets you, and then rolls 2d8 cutting damage., which shows a 6 and a 5. Adding these together, the Behemoth gets a *Damage Dealt* of 11!
#### Defense Defense Defense !
Now that damage has been rolled, you must defend! There are *two* Active Defenses, which are **Dodge** and **Block**. When making your defense, take your pick of the litter. Some weapons are better at one or the other, and some do both well. 

Just like with an attack, in order to Defend, you need to find a total dice pool, then roll it. In order to do that, find your weapon's base Defense die for the option you chose. For the sake of example, lets say you're **Blocking**, your weapon gives you a d10, and the action you're using doesn't change the die. Now, armed with the die size, you find the amount of that die. For this example, we'll say you get 2d10 to defend with. This is your Defense Dice Pool for this action!

You then roll your dice, which show a 7 and a 2, for a total of 9. This is the *Damage Defended* for this action! You then subtract the *Damage Defended* from the *Damage Dealt,* or in this case, 11 minus 9. This equals 2 cutting damage. 

Now that you've *actively* defended, your *passive* defenses are now applied. These are your **Resistances**, which are explained in more detail later on, in the Armor section, but they act as "flat" damage reduction, which just means you subtract your Resistance from the leftover damage. In this case, we'll say you **Resist** 1 cut damage, leaving you taking a paltry 1 cut damage. 

You mark 1 damage on your Breaker sheet, then keep going with the combat.
##### Combat Success and Failure 
Despite a lack of test in combat, *Strike* and *Defense* actions still have a measure of success, just like tests. 

An attack that deal *no* damage to its target is considered a failed attack, while an attack that deals *any* damage is a successful attack. Any attack that deals maximum possible damage (the highest number on every die in the pool) is a critical success (or *critical hit*)! Meanwhile, any attack that deals the minimum possible damage is a critical failure (or *critical blunder*). 

Defenses work similarly; any defense that allows any damage through (before Resistances) is a failed defense (commonly referred to as a *Partial* defense), while any defense that allows *no* damage through (before Resistances) is a successful defense (and this is commonly referred to as a *Complete* defense.) A defense in which all dice in the pool show their highest numbers is a critical success (or a *Perfect* defense), while a defense in which all dice show their lowest numbers is a critical failure (or a *Pathetic* defense).
###### Unconquerable!
Sometimes, the dice align in a manner where, even with a Perfect defense and all of a character's Resistances, they could not prevent all of the damage. Commonly, this signals a powerful attack! However, sometimes, this situation arises *and* the attack itself is a critical hit. When all of these circumstances align, that attack is what is known as *Unconquerable*. 

When an attack is Unconquerable, you might assume there is no use in defending, but there is a hope: if you achieve a Perfect defense against an Unconquerable attack, you negate *all* damage, regardless of circumstance.
## Attribute and Skill Traits 
"*Trait*" is the catch-all term for any numerical component of a character. Their main function is to act a modifier to a **Target Number** when making a test. *Derived* traits, which are described below, are an exception to this. 
### Primary Attribute Traits 
These traits are the most broad, general overview of a character's abilities. Think of them as trunks of trees.

Primary Attribute traits are determined by choices during character creation. 
- ***Physicality*** governs physical prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for front-liners who expect to take heavy damage.
- ***Mentality*** governs mental prowess and ability.
This trait is most important for those who want to outsmart and outwit Behemoths.
- ***Spirituality*** governs the connection to one's self.
This trait is most important for those who expect to rely on magic and ranged weaponry. 
### Secondary Attribute Traits 
These traits are slightly more specialized, though they are still quite broad; think of these as the branches of a tree. 

Secondary Attribute traits are calculated quite easily; any given Secondary Attribute trait is an allocation of its governing Primary Attribute trait. For example, if a Breaker has ***Physicality*** 6, their **Strength** and **Agility** must add up to 6, in any manner desired, as long as both Secondary Attribute traits are **at least** 1. Remember: **Any given Secondary Attribute trait must be, at minimum, 1.**
#### Physical Secondaries
- **Strength** is a measure of one's gross motor control.
- **Agility** is a measure of one's fine motor control.
#### Mental Secondaries
- **Will** is a measure of mental strength.
- **Intellect** is a measure of mental dexterity.
#### Spiritual Secondaries
- **Connection** is a measure of how well one converses with others.
- **Soul** is a measure of how well one is aware of themself.
### Skill Traits
Skill traits are the most "specialized" trait, though they still do not key themselves to one specific action. Think of these as the leaves and twigs on a tree's branch. 

In order to calculate a Skill trait, 
>[!aside|right] 
>#### Being Gifted
>Each School allows a Breaker to be *gifted* in a small selection of Skill traits.  When you are Gifted in a Skill, your *maximum Skill Level* for that Skill is *doubled*. 
#### Physical Skills
- *Power* is a measure of one's raw bodily power.
- *Fortitude* is a measure of one's bodily fortitude.
- *Dexterity* is a measure of one's grace and manual coordination.
- *Speed* is a measure of one's speed and reaction time.
#### Mental Skills
- *Observation*: Tertiary Trait; a measure of one's perceptions, both passive and active.
- *Resolve* is a measure of one's raw willpower.
- *Crafting* is a measure of one's ability to create practical things.
- *Memory* is a measure of how robust one's recall is.
#### Spiritual Skills
- *Appeal* is a measure of how one entertains and convinces others.
- *Portrayal* is a measure of how one carries themselves
- *Tenacity* is a measure of how powerful one's personality is.
- *Creativity* is a measure of how well one can create abstract things.
## Derived Traits 
Some traits are combinations of others; these are referred to as *derived* traits. These such traits are typically a combination of two or three traits, though specific details are given under each derived traits' entry below.
### Health 
In *Behemoth Breakers*, Health is divided into two distinct pools: *Mortal* Health and *Surface* Health. These are two independent pools, and are tracked separately, yet they still depend on one another. Occasionally, a rule will reference *Total* Health, which is exactly as it sounds: the summation of both Health pool types.
#### Mortal Health 
*Mortal* Health, referred to commonly as mHP, is a distinct measure of how much bodily damage a character can withstand before *dying*. *Mortal* Health damage is typically only dealt once a character's *Surface* Health has been depleted, though there are some Behemoth hazards and attacks that deal *Deadly* damage, which can *bypass* *Surface* Health! 

***The Math***
A Breaker's mHP is the result of **Physicality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Health**.
#### Surface Health
Unlike mHP, *Surface* Health (commonly abbreviated as sHP) is less a strict measure of physical ability and more-so a rationalization of near-misses, scrapes and grazes, luck, and combat constitution. Damage is typically done to sHP *first*, which is a great thing, considering Breakers have much more of it than they do mHP!

***The Math***
A Breaker's sHP is the result of **2**×**mHP**
#### Total Health
Total Health, or tHP, is just as it sounds; the total of both of a Breaker's Health pools. This trait is rarely referenced, but when it is, it is typically by *very* powerful effects, such as a Usurper-class Behemoth with the ability to *outright kill* low tHP Breakers. Scary stuff, man.

***The Math***
A Breaker's tHP is **mHP**+**sHP**.
### Stamina 
Stamina fuels a Breaker's more rigorous combat abilities, such as the Musketeer's **Perfect Shot** or the War Wheel's **Rev Roto-Engine**. Most Breakers have a fair amount of it, and it comes back pretty quickly; the rate at which it does so is called Stamina *Regeneration*.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Stamina is the result of **Physicality**+**Mentality**+**Base Stamina**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Stamina**/**2**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Mana 
Magic is not free, obviously, and as such, one needs a way to fuel it. That is where Mana comes into play. A Breaker's more *arcane* abilities, such as the Crusader's **Divine Light** cost Mana to use (and some, like the Shadow's **Shadowsneak**, even cost *both*.) Mana *also* regenerates on a per round basis, though at a much slower rate.

***The Math***
A Breaker's Mana is the result of **Mentality**+**Spirituality**+**Base Mana**, and its Regeneration rate is the result of **Mana**/**4**. Remember, always ***round down.***
### Base Weapon Damage
All weapons deal damage! Shocker. 

Previously, a *Weapon Damage Die Pool* was mentioned. This section explains how to assemble that pool with much more depth than that example did.
#### Base Damage Die Size 
Die size is dependent on two factors: the weapon itself, and the action being performed. We're finding our starting point, however, so actions are not factored in here. 

Your Base Damage Die Size is found in your **Weapon**'s data entry.
#### Base Damage Die Amount 
The amount of dice in your Weapon Damage is dependent on your Tier. See the chart below.

|    Tiers     | Value |
|:------------:|:-----:|
|    Novice    |   1   |
|  Journeyman  |   2   |
|    Adept     |   3   |
| Professional |   4   |

#### Damage Types
Much like **Resistances**, Damage Types are separated into categories called **Physical** and **Elemental**. Within these, there are *base* damage types and *combined* damage types. Combined damage types *combine* the aspects of two (or more) base types, and are thus affected by anything that would affect any of its constituents.
##### Physical Damage Types 
All of these damage types are affected by **Physical Resistance**.
###### Base Types 
- Cutting (cut) damage can sever Behemoth parts such as tails.
- Crushing (cr) damage can knock out Behemoths when applied to the head, and break off horns and armor plates.
- Piercing (pi) damage can push past Behemoth armor and deals extra damage to Behemoth constructs.
###### Combined Damage Types
- Maiming (ma) is a combination of: *crushing* and *cutting*.
- Impaling (imp) is a combination of: *crushing* and *piercing*.
- Shredding (shr) is a combination of: *crushing* and *piercing*.
##### Elemental Damage Types
All of these damage types are affected by **Elemental Resistance**.
###### Base Types 
- Fire (fi) damage can ignite Behemoths and their constructs.
- Water (wr) damage can wash off protective Behemoth secretions.
- Earthen (eth) damage pummels Behemoths, weakening its armor.
- Air (air) damage lacerates the Behemoth, allowing for more part damage.
- Light (lig) damage enshrouds Behemoths, stopping stealth maneuvers and permitting better tracking.
- Dark (dar) damage dampens Behemoth elemental ability. 
###### Combined Damage Types
There are no combined Elemental damage types at this time. 
### Defenses 
Mentioned earlier was the idea of *defenses.* Like most other things, they too are a type of trait. Wild, right? Defenses specifically help you avoid injury, either *actively* in the form of **Blocking** and **Dodging**, or   *passively* in the form of **Resistances**. 
#### Active Defenses
The active defenses, while still derived traits, work a little differently due to the fact that one of the traits that they are based upon is a die. When calculating these traits, the trait with the die indicates only the *value*, the other components of the trait will determine the *amount* of dice.
##### Dodge 
Dodging is the act of simply moving out of the way of an attack! There's much more to it than that, but that's the basics. When you see an attack coming, a well-timed dive, side-step, or even *lean* will get you out of the trajectory of a devastating blow.

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Dodge** dice pool is the result of (**Mentality**+**Spirituality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Dodge.
##### Block 
Blocking, unlike dodging, is *not* the act of moving out of the way of an attack. Instead, it is the act of *putting something between you and the danger.* Much more dangerous, yet much more rewarding as well!

***The Math***
The *amount* Breaker's **Block** dice pool is the result of (**Physicality**+**Mentality**)/**4**, while the die **size** is determined by the weapon's Base Block.
#### Passive Defense
There is only one type of Passive Defense, which is **Resistance**. Resistance comes in two forms, or subtypes: *Physical* **Resistance**, which prevents a portion of all **Physical** damage, and *Elemental* **Resistance**, which prevents a portion of all **Elemental** damage. Pretty simple. 
##### Resistances
Both types of Resistances are simply the sum of the **Resistance** values given by all of your equipped armor, and occasionally, equipment. Some abilities will also give **Resistances**.
### Size 
Size is simple. It tells you how many spaces your character takes up at its widest edge. Size is most commonly 1, which is just 1 space, but Size 2 would mean you instead take up a 2x2 square of spaces (or 4 spaces.) Size 3 would be a 3x3 (9 spaces), and so on and so forth. Size 0 and lower means you do not actively take up a whole space; Size 0 takes up half a space, -1 takes up a fourth, so on and so forth. 
### Move
**Move** is simply how far you can move during your turn; it is highly dependent on Size and the *Speed* Skill trait. Typically, a Breaker will only have a *Ground* **Move**, but some other options will give new types of Move. These are calculated the same way, unless stated otherwise. Remember, specific beats general. 

***The Math***
A Breaker's starting Move is the result of **4** + (**Size**×2) plus an additional **1** for every **five** Skill Levels (*not* Points) a Breaker has in the *Speed* skill trait.
# Part 2: A Company of  Behemoth Breakers
## Before You Begin 
Before you sit down and begin writing things on the paper or typing out things on a PDF, keep a few things in mind.
- Make sure you have a concept in mind. Think of this as "Step 0" of character creation.
- Collaborate with your fellow Breakers to see what all similarities everyone wants to have, such as everyone playing a Lo'darlyr or everyone taking the same School. 
Keep these things in mind, as well as anything your game group finds uncomfortable, as you create your Breaker.
## Creating a Breaker
These are the steps to follow in order to make a Breaker!
### Step 1. 
Select your Breaker's **Species**; this is what culture they belong to. Record your Base Health, Base Mana, and Base Stamina Derived traits, any abilities gained, and your bonuses to your Primary Attribute traits, on your Breaker sheet. Remember, all three Primary Attribute traits start at 2, and you're going to add the adjustments to that base of 2! You'll do this for the next three steps as well. 
> [!cards]
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Humankind** are highly adaptable generalists that can fill any role on any time.
>
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Pillarad** are a strong and spiritual people that have a deep connection to the Uberwald.
> 
> **![[Species Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Lo'darlyr** are ancient mana-driven golems constructed by the Apex and discovered by the Pillarad.
### Step 2. 
Select your Breaker's **Job**; this is the role they fill within the Company. After you make your selection, record any abilities gained and your Primary Attribute trait bonuses on your Breaker sheet. 
> [!cards|4]
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Master Smithy** holds the position of ensuring Breakers are armed and equipped for hunts.

> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Head Researcher** ensures that Breakers are educated on their marks.

> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Entertainments Master** has the job of keeping the Company entertained.
>
> **![[Job Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
> **Retired Breaker** used to be knee-deep in the action, but took a backseat to new blood, and recently has been forced back into action. 
### Step 3. 
Select your Breaker's **School**; this is the methodology of Behemoth Hunting they are learned in. Make sure you record your Primary Attribute trait adjustments, as well as your School's abilities and actions, on your Breaker sheet. Be keen to mark your Gifted Skill traits, too!

>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Peerless Shadow** sits in the bleak shadow to ensure a powerful, singular blow.
>
>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Tenacious Invoker** shapes mana into the wicked force of elementia itself.

>**![[School Placeholder.png|htiny]]**
>**School of the Patient Caller** utilizes spirits to heal allies.
### Step 4. 
Select your Breaker's **Weapon**; this is the tool they use to hunt Behemoths. Make sure you have your Weapon Actions and mechanics handy, and that you record its Primary Attribute trait adjustments, Defenses, and base Weapon Damage die size.

### Step 5. 
Determine your Breaker's **Primary  Attribute Traits**, which are adjusted by the previous four choices. Remember, they begin at 2, and you add the adjustments to that. 
### Step 6. 
Determine your Breaker's **Secondary Attribute Traits**, which are allocated based off their Primary Traits. Each pair of Secondary Attribute traits *cannot* exceed its governing Primary Attribute trait, and it cannot be less than 1. 
### Step 7. 
Spend your 10 starting Skill Points (SP) on **Skill Traits**. Keep in mind that each Skill trait cannot exceed its governing Secondary Attribute trait, unless it is a  Gifted Skill trait, which have their limit *doubled.*
### Step 8. 
Calculate your **Health**, **Stamina**, **Mana**, **Dodge**, **Block** and **Move**. See each of these entries in the Traits section for information how to to calculate them. 
### Step 9. 
Use your starting budget of 2,000 **crowns** to purchase equipment, including starting armor and weaponry. Keep in mind that crafting materials are tracked separately from the  rest of your inventory.
### Step 10.
Finally, describe your Breaker's appearance, fill out their **biography**, and choose their **name** and **pronouns**! Don't forget to mark your Tier on your character sheet too.

### Schools 
All Breakers hunt Behemoths, but almost none of them will do it the exact same way as another. This *could* be due to choice of weaponry, or how many Breakers they prefer in their hunting party, but most commonly, these differences are simply due to the Breakers' *School.*

The Twelve Breaker Schools have twelve different origin stories, as well as twelve different combat methodologies and twelve different life philosophies. The only thing they share, however, is the burden of training some poor commoner to slay a massive, hulking beast from the Uberwald. This burden is an ancient one, and without the Schools fulfilling it, Behemoths surely would rule the world. 

The Breaker's League categorizes the Schools into three *Charters.* These Charters group the schools by the scant similarities in their methods and ideals. When selecting your School, keep in mind that these Charters have no mechanical impact, but *do* have quite the big impact in roleplay! The Charters love a good rivalry, even if they all share a common goal.
#### The Ruby Drums Charter 
The first of the three Charters, the Ruby Drums are united under one idea: *"Might makes right."* Little else unites them; the in-fighting and rivalry amongst these Schools is second to none. 
##### School of the Raging Berserker
> [!statblocks|columns]
>
>> [!blank]  
>> ##### School of the Raging Berserker
>>> Embodying primal rage, thunderous passion and violent fury, Berserkers merciless hunt down Behemoths by straddling the line between lucidity and complete consumption. As the Behemoth wounds the Berserker, their anger grows, and as their anger grows, their strength does as well. It is here, in this space between life and death, that true anger can be found; the anger against the thought of dying.

### Weaponry
>[!info]- Action Tags 1: The Glossary.
> Below is a small glossary of some important action tags, alongside their rules.
>- **Block** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Blocking, and provides how that action changes the Block Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Block -2" is an action that lowers (-) Block Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Block +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Charged** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag can have a number of *additional* actions spent on them in order to gain bonus effects, which are listed in the actions *Charged* section.  
>- **Combo** Actions with this tag are typically done in sequence. After performing a *Combo* action, your *Combo Count* increases by 1. It further increments by 1 for each *Combo* action you take, and resets to 0 when you take an action without this tag.
>- **Combo-Breaker** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cannot be used unless you have a *Combo Count* equal to or higher than the qualifier. 
>- **Dodge** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves Dodging, and provides how that action changes the Dodge Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Dodge -2" is an action that lowers (-) Dodge Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Dodge +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered an *Active Defense*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Drawing** Actions with this tag allow the user to draw the weapon they plan on using the action with as part of it, forgoing the need to **Draw a Weapon**.
>- **Flourish** Actions with this tag can only be performed once per turn. 
>- **Mana** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost mana to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
>- **Move** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this trait allow the user to move as part of the action, up to a number of spaces given in the qualifier. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Open** An action with this tag can only be used if its the first action of that type you take on your turn. The *type* tags are: Strike, Move, and Defense. 
>- **Piercing** *Strike* actions with this tag ignore half of a Behemoth's applicable Resistances.
>- **Reach** This tag always has a qualifier. *Strike* actions with this tag have their effective targeting area (or reach) increased by the qualifier.
>- **Riposte** This tag always has a qualifier, and always is accompanied by the *Block* tag. Actions with this tag allow a counterattack after successfully blocking an attack. This counterattack can be any *Strike* action that requires a number of actions given in the qualifier (that you could otherwise perform.)
>- **Stamina** This tag always has a qualifier. Actions with this tag cost stamina to use, and that cost is given in the qualifier for this tag. 
>- **Strike** This tag always has a qualifier. This tag shows up on every single action that involves making an attack, and provides how that action changes the Damage Die size of the weapon in its qualifier. For example, an action with "Strike -2" is an attack that lowers (-) Damage Die size by two (2) steps, meanwhile "Strike +1" would increase (+) it by one (1). "+0" means no change. Actions with this tag are considered *attacks*. *This is a type tag.*
>- **Stunning** *Strike* actions with this tag increase their Weapon Die size by 1 step when dealing damage to a Behemoth's Head (or equivalent.)

*How* a Breaker fights is defined by their School, but *what* they fight *with* is a different story entirely. That question is answered by what Breaker Weapon they use. These weapons are special-engineered to allow the much-smaller mortalkind Breakers to effectively deal with Behemoths. 

Each weapon is specialized to a certain style or method of hunting, which is what allows for the wide diversity of Breaker hunting styles despite there only being 12 Schools. 

These weapons are grouped by their similarities (with these categories being called *Weapon Classes*), which tends to primarily be weight and size. They are grouped this way due to these factors being what restricts a Breaker's Defenses. After all, a rolling Dodge is much easier with a small pair of Bomba Pistols than it is with a giant Cleaver-Scythe.
#### Heavy-Class Weaponry
These are the biggest of the Breaker Weapons, and for what they lack in maneuverability, they make up for in sheer might and/or blocking power. Breakers cannot effectively **Dodge** while equipped with a Heavy-class weapon, but in return, these Breakers can withstand almost any assault.
##### Cleaver-Scythe

>> ##### Cleaver-Scythe
>> ***Heavy-Class***
>> > A massive, cleaving scythe that utilizes a mana-driven momentum sink in order to greatly increase the swinging force of the weapon. This momentum sink can also be purged at will, allowing for the user to change directions mid-swing or even pivot into a blocking stance.

#### Agile-Class Weaponry
>[!info]- Action Tags 2: Qualifiers and You 
>Some tags have *qualifiers.* These are numbers (or die values) that are referenced by a mechanical effect! Here is clarification on how some of the more unique instances of a qualifier work:
> - **"Tag-Name X"** When a tag has a qualifier with a variable in it, the action itself will give you information on how to decide it. Other examples include: **"Tag-Name XdY"**.
> - **"Tag-Name T"** When a tag has the letter "T" as a qualifier, it is referring to a *trait.* The trait in reference will be given in the action, unless it is a *Move* action. "Move T" always refers to your character's **Move** derived trait. This *can* be combined with a variable, though this is rare.

While lacking in size (though not by much,) these Breaker Weapons are much more agile and mobile, allowing for the Breakers that use them to keep up high pressure while deftly avoiding damage. 

Breakers cannot **Block** while equipped with a Agile-Class weapon, but in return, they can avoid nearly any attack!

>>> [!info|no-i txt-l bg-gray]- **Dancing Pace**
>>> Each pair of Bomba Pistols has a number of attacks that, when made in a single turn, cause the weapons' thumperdrums to resonate with mana. Meeting this condition is called being *On Pace,* which can activate certain conditions.
>>---

#### Balance-Class Weaponry
Unlike the other two classes of weaponry, the Balance-Class arsenal allows a Breaker to keep sway by **Dodging**, but also hold the line by **Blocking**. One small caveat, however: they will not be as good at either of them! Balance-Class weapons are *balanced*, after all, not *biased*. 
##### Breaker Fists
> [!statblocks|columns 5]
> 
> 
>> ###### Breaker Fists
>> ***Balance-Class***
>>> A set of large leather and metal gauntlets, which cover up to one's elbow, that sport massive spikes or razor-sharp claws for offense. The gauntlets also boast sizable interlocking plates that can be used for blocking.  Finally, these swift weapons have mana-burner boosters in the hands that can be used to accelerate the user out of the way of attacks or at a Behemoth for incredible damage.

### Equipment 
This section contains all of the personal equipment a Breaker might need for their hunts.
#### Inventory 
A Breaker's inventory has limited space; you have 16 "slots" to carry Breaker equipment with you in the field. Weapons and armor do not count towards this limit, and you can carry a number of any given equipment item equal to the qualifier of its Carry tag.

Crafting materials are tracked separately; they have their own 16-slot inventory. 
#### Arms and Armor
##### Breaker Weapons 
###### Femurstone Weaponry
*Femurstone* is the name given to Behemoth bone that has been treated with alchemical reagents in order to render it pliable while keeping its strength and reducing its brittleness. Weapons made using this material are cheap, and are commonly taken by neophyte Breakers.

###### Myterran Alloy Weaponry
*Myterran Alloy* is a metal that is created through alloying Myterite, a shallow-depth hard metal, with a blend of stabilizing metals and Behemoth blood. While also commonly used for new Breakers, this material is reserved for more talented Breakers due to being more expensive and slightly unwieldly due to the higher weight.

# ***Section 2: Testing The Test***
Now that you've made your character, its time to make your *first ever* trait test in *Fable of the Behemoth Breakers*! For each of the sections, you'll make two different tests; the first is "simple" and shows common-use cases, while the second is a more "complex" test that shows less common use-cases. 

A reminder: if you didn't read Part 1 of Section 1, I recommend going back and reading it now. It explains how these tests work *in the way that the CRB will*, which is why I am not reproducing those rules here. Also, make sure you're taking notes on the way the game feels while making these tests. Game-feel feedback is super important.
## Primary Attribute Tests 
These two tests are testing *Primary Attribute* traits.
### #1  Simple 
You attempt to catch a large boulder as it flies towards your ally. Make an *average* ***Physicality*** test. 
-  What is your final TN for this test? Include the value of the relevant trait.
### #2 Complex
You struggle against a Behemoth's psionic attack. Make a *hard* ***Mentality*** test with a +3 item bonus. 
## Secondary Attribute Tests 
These two tests are testing *Secondary Attribute* traits.
### #1  Simple 
You attempt to connect to a long-extinct Behemoth spirit. Make an *average* **Connection** test.
### #2 Complex
A rival Breaker attempts to best you in a game of wits. Make a *very easy* **Intellect** test with a +2 item bonus and a -2 circumstance penalty.
- What is your final TN for this test? Include the value of the relevant trait.
## Skill Tests 
These two tests are testing *Skill* traits.
### #1  Simple 
You attempt to outpace a Behemoth. Make an *easy Speed* test.
### #2 Complex
You attempt to come up with a brand new color. Make an *extreme Creativity* test with a +4 item bonus, +2 item bonus, -3 item penalty, +1 circumstance bonus, and a -5 status penalty.
- What is your final TN for this test? Include the value of the relevant trait.
- What is the final item bonus for this test? 
- What is the final modifier for this test?

# Conclusion
I'd like to thank you for your time, and I sincerely hope you had fun. If you didn't, then I apologize!
Make sure you tell me why; that's how I improve the game! 

I look forward you participating in the next playtest, should you decide to do so. 
Next time, we'll be creating our Companies.

Remember hunters, the *Uberwald needs to be tamed, and only a Company of Behemoth Breakers can do it.*
