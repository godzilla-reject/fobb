A family of quadrupedal feline Behemoths that boast powerful blade-like appendages on their arms, as well as blade-sharp metal fangs. Some member species have adapted to be able to use powerful Sound elementia, using the cacophony of their blades to stun and injure prey. Rumor has it that the most apex of the Nekon Behemoths can even manipulate Silence as well, weaponizing the Zero Sum Difference.
